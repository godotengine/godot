#### Build system

- [Add `production=yes` option to set optimal options for production builds](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/45593).
  - Users making custom builds should use this option which is equivalent to `use_lto=yes debug_symbols=no use_static_cpp=yes`.
  - **Note for Linux builds:** `use_static_cpp=yes` and `udev=yes` are now the default values, so you need `libudev` and `libstdc++-static` development packages to build in optimal conditions.
- [Add `optimize=none` to disable C/C++ compiler optimizations for release builds](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/46966).
  - This can be used to speed up compile times when working on the engine itself and when debug checks/features aren't desired.

#### Core

- [New dynamic BVH for rendering and the GodotPhysics backends](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44901).
  - If you experience a regression in either physics or rendering, you can try [these Project Settings](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/44901#issuecomment-758618531) to revert back to the previous Octree-based approach and possibly fix the issue. In either case, be sure to report the problem on GitHub.

#### Rendering

- [2D batching for GLES3](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/42119) (it was implemented for GLES2 in 3.2.2), and improvements to GLES2's batching.
- [New *experimental* buffer orphan/stream project settings to improve 2D performance on specific platforms](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/47864).
- [New software skinning for MeshInstance](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/40313) to replace the slow GPU skinning on devices that don't support the fast GPU skinning (especially mobile).
- [Configurable amount of lights per object](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/43606), now defaulting to 32 instead of 8.

- Functions called from a signal can no longer disconnect the node from the signal they're connected to (unless using `call_deferred()`).
- Tabs and space indentation can no longer be mixed in the same GDScript file.
  - Each file must now use only tabs or spaces for indentation (not both).
- `assert()` in GDScript must now always be used with parentheses.
  - `assert(true)` is still valid, but `assert true` isn't valid anymore.
  - This is to account for the optional second parameter that defines a custom message.
- The "Trim" and "Normalize" WAV import options are now disabled by default.
  - This makes the default behavior more consistent with Ogg import.
- Ogg samples now have an icon in the editor, like WAV samples.
- Camera2D drag margins are now disabled by default.
  - If porting a project from Godot 3.1 where drag margins were used, these must be enabled manually again.
- The Camera2D Offset property now ignores the Limit property.
  - To get the old behavior back, move the camera itself instead of changing the offset.
- `Camera.project_position()` now requires a second `depth` argument to determine the distance of the point from the camera.
  - To get the old behavior back, pass the Camera's `near` property value as the second argument.
- `Skeleton.set_bone_global_pose()` was replaced by `Skeleton.set_bone_global_pose_override()`.

- Refactored the Project Manager to be more efficient, especially with large project lists.
- Images in the Project Manager and Asset Library are now resized with Lanczos filtering for a smoother appearance.
- The editor now uses the font hinting algorithm that best matches the OS' default.
  - Hinting is set to "None" on macOS, and set to "Light" on Windows and Linux.
  - This can be changed in the Editor Settings.
- The editor window dimming when a popup appears is now less intense (60% → 50%).
  - The animation was also removed as it made the editor feel sluggish at lower FPS.

  - This makes directional shadow rendering consistent between the editor and running project when using the default Camera node settings.
- Tweaked the default depth fog maximum distance to be independent of the Camera's `far` value (0..100).
  - This makes fog display consistent between the editor and a running project.
- Tweaked the default height fog values to be more logical (0..100 → 10..0).
  - This means height fog will be drawn from top-to-bottom, instead of being drawn from bottom-to-top.
- Significantly improved SSAO performance by using a lower sample count.
  - SSAO now uses 3×3 blurring by default, resulting in less visible noise patterns.
- When "Keep 3D Linear" is enabled, colors are no longer clamped to [0, 1] when using Linear tonemapping.
  - This allows rendering HDR values in floating-point texture targets for further processing or saving HDR data into files.

- Transform's `FLIP_Y` and `FLIP_Z` constants now work as expected.
- Fixed importing BMP images.
- The positional command-line argument is now only considered to be a scene path if it ends with `.scn`, `.tscn` or `.escn`.

  - This also makes it possible to use file associations or drag-and-drop and have the positional argument parsed by the project.
- The `--audio-driver` and `--video-driver` command-line arguments are now validated; an error message will be printed if an invalid value is passed.
