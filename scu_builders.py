# "folders" is a list of folders to add all the files from to add to the SCU
# "section (like a module)". The name of the scu file will be derived from the first folder
# (thus e.g. scene/3d becomes scu_scene_3d.gen.cpp)

# "includes_per_scu" limits the number of includes in a single scu file.
# This allows the module to be built in several translation units instead of just 1.
# This will usually be slower to compile but will use less memory per compiler instance, which
# is most relevant in release builds.

# "sought_exceptions" are a list of files (without extension) that contain
# e.g. naming conflicts, and are therefore not suitable for the scu build.
# These will automatically be placed in their own separate scu file,
# which is slow like a normal build, but prevents the naming conflicts.
# Ideally in these situations, the source code should be changed to prevent naming conflicts.
