This folder contains files with the expected output of `--validate-extension-api` when run against the `extension_api.json`.

Only lines that start with "Validate extension JSON:" matter, everything else is considered a comment and ignored. They
should instead be used to justify these changes and describe how users should work around these changes.

Add new entries to the `{TAG}` folder.
