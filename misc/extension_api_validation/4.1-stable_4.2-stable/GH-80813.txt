Validate extension JSON: Error: Field 'classes/AnimationPlayer/methods/seek/arguments': size changed value in new API, from 2 to 3.
Validate extension JSON: Error: Field 'classes/AnimationTree/methods/get_tree_root/return_value': type changed value in new API, from "AnimationNode" to "AnimationRootNode".
Validate extension JSON: Error: Field 'classes/AnimationTree/methods/set_tree_root/arguments/0': type changed value in new API, from "AnimationNode" to "AnimationRootNode".

These definitions have been moved to those base classes, so the APIs are actually available.
Some properties were renamed for integration, but the old setter/getters are kept.
Also changed some methods name/argument/signature. Compatibility methods registered.
