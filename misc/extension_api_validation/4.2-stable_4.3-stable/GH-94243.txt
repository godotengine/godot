GH-94243
--------
Validate extension JSON: Error: Field 'classes/Image/methods/get_mipmap_offset/return_value': meta changed value in new API, from "int32" to "int64".

Type changed to int64_t to support baking large lightmaps.
No compatibility method needed, both GDExtension and C# generate it as int64_t anyway.
