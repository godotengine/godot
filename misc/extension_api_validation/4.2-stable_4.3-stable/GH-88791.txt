GH-88791
--------
Validate extension JSON: JSON file: Field was added in a way that breaks compatibility 'classes/Skeleton3D/methods/add_bone': return_value

Added a return value for add_bone.
Should not affect existing regular use - the return value would just be unused.
Compatibility method registered.
