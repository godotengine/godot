GH-78237
--------
Validate extension JSON: Error: Field 'classes/WebRTCPeerConnectionExtension/methods/_create_data_channel/return_value': type changed value in new API, from "Object" to "WebRTCDataChannel".

This method does not affect the state of Viewport so it should be const.


GH-74736
--------

The previous type was simply wrong and the getter and setter already used int.


GH-74671
--------
Validate extension JSON: Error: Field 'native_structures/PhysicsServer3DExtensionMotionCollision': format changed value in new API, from "Vector3 position;Vector3 normal;Vector3 collider_velocity;real_t depth;int local_shape;ObjectID collider_id;RID collider;int collider_shape" to "Vector3 position;Vector3 normal;Vector3 collider_velocity;Vector3 collider_angular_velocity;real_t depth;int local_shape;ObjectID collider_id;RID collider;int collider_shape".

The previous type was simply wrong and didn't match the actual C++ definition. Code targeting previous versions should use the updated definition as well.
