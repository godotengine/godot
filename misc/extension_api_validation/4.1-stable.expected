This file contains the expected output of --validate-extension-api when run against the extension_api.json of the
4.1-stable tag (the basename of this file).

Only lines that start with "Validate extension JSON:" matter, everything else is considered a comment and ignored. They
should instead be used to justify these changes and describe how users should work around these changes.

Add new entries at the end of the file.

## Changes between 4.1-stable and 4.2-stable

GH-73196
--------
Validate extension JSON: Error: Field 'classes/CodeEdit/methods/get_text_for_symbol_lookup': is_const changed value in new API, from false to true.

Function was made `const`. No adjustments should be necessary.


GH-78328
--------
Validate extension JSON: Error: Field 'classes/TileMap/methods/get_used_rect': is_const changed value in new API, from false to true.

Function was made `const`. No adjustments should be necessary.
