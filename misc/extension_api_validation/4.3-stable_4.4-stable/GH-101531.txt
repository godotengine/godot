GH-101531
---------
Validate extension JSON: API was removed: classes/EditorSceneFormatImporter/methods/_get_import_flags

This virtual method, and the internal public `get_import_flags`, were never used by the engine, since it was open sourced.
So we're removing it despite the compat breakage as there's no way for users to rely on this affecting engine behavior.
