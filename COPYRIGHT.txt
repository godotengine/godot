# Exhaustive licensing information for files in the Godot Engine repository
# =========================================================================
#
# This file aims at documenting the copyright and license for every source
# file in the Godot Engine repository, and especially outline the files
# whose license differs from the MIT/Expat license used by Godot Engine.
#
# It is written as a machine-readable format following the debian/copyright
# specification. Globbing patterns (e.g. "Files: *") mean that they affect
# all corresponding files (also recursively in subfolders), apart from those
# with a more explicit copyright statement.
#
# Licenses are given with their debian/copyright short name (or SPDX identifier
# if no standard short name exists) and are all included in plain text at the
# end of this file (in alphabetical order).
#
# Disclaimer for thirdparty libraries:
# ------------------------------------
#
# Licensing details for thirdparty libraries in the 'thirdparty/' directory
# are given in summarized form, i.e. with only the "main" license described
# in the library's license statement. Different licenses of single files or
# code snippets in thirdparty libraries are not documented here.
# For example:
#   Files: ./thirdparty/zlib/
#   Copyright: 1995-2017, Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler
#   License: Zlib
# The exact copyright for each file in that library *may* differ, and some
# files or code snippets might be distributed under other compatible licenses
# (e.g. a public domain dedication), but as far as Godot Engine is concerned
# the library is considered as a whole under the Zlib license.
#
# Nota: When linking dynamically against thirdparty libraries instead of
# building them into the Godot binary, you may remove the corresponding
# license details from this file.

License: CC0-1.0
 CC0 1.0 Universal
 .
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
 subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
 authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
 purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
 works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
 claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
 and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
 purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
 contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
 further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
 reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
 efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
 of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
 Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
 and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
 and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
 effect of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
 Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
 to, the following:
 .
 i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
 and translate a Work;
 .
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 .
 iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
 depicted in a Work;
 .
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
 subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 .
 v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
 a Work;
 .
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
 European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
 protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
 including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
 .
 vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
 based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
 applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
 unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
 and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
 known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
 action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
 duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
 extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
 copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
 commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
 the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
 detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
 shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
 any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
 by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
 judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
 shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
 Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
 is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
 non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
 unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
 the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
 provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
 in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
 purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
 promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
 of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
 License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
 applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
 invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
 affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
 and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
 Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
 surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 .
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
 of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
 including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
 for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
 other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
 discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 .
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
 that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
 any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
 disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
 or other rights required for any use of the Work.
 .
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
 party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
 CC0 or use of the Work.

 in part; and
 .

 authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
 necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including

 may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
 are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected

 provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

 assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
 extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
 Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
 Public License.
 .
 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
 collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
 Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society

 information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
 reasonably practicable.
 .
 4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
 License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
 Material from complying with this Public License.
 .
 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
 a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
 to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
 portion of the contents of the database;

 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed

 COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
 USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
 ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
 DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
 IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
 above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
 possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
 waiver of all liability.

 Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
 this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
 terminate automatically.

 b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
 Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
 it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
 violation; or

 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
 right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations

 conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
 be made without permission under this Public License.
 .
 b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
 deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
 minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
 cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
 without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
 conditions.
 .

 Introduction
 ============
 .
 The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
 some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
 various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
 FreeType Project.
 .
 This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
 which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
 affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
 documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
 .
 This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
 (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
 and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
 alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
 .
   o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
     interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
 .
   o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
     full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
 .
   o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
     it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
     somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
     FreeType code. (`credits')
 .
 We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
 software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
 We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
 assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
 .
 .
 Legal Terms
 ===========
 .
 0. Definitions
 --------------
 .
 Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
 and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
 distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
 Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
 beta or final release.
 .
 `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
 `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
 code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
 This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
 engine'.
 .
 This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
 FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
 documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
 original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
 If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
 this license, you must contact us to verify this.
 .
 The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
 Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as

 THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
 WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
 BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
 USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
 .
 2. Redistribution
 -----------------
 .
 This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
 irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
 display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
 sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
 forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
 authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
 herein, subject to the following conditions:
 .
   o Redistribution  of source code  must retain this  license file
     (`LICENSE.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes
     to   the  original   files  must   be  clearly   indicated  in
     accompanying  documentation.   The  copyright notices  of  the
     unaltered, original  files must be preserved in  all copies of
     source files.
 .
   o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
     states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
     FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
     encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
     documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
 .
 These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
 the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
 our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
 to us.
 .
 3. Advertising
 --------------
 .
 Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
 the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
 purposes without specific prior written permission.
 .
 We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
 following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
 or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
 `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
 .
 As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
 accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
 material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
 authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
 Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
 Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
 of this license.

 .
 3. Responsibilities
 -------------------
 .
 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
 .
 All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
 Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
 the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
 Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
 License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
 attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
 Form.
 .
 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
 .
 If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
 .
 (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
 .
 (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
 .
 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
 .
 You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
 provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
 the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
 Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
 Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
 License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
 under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
 the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
 Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
 License(s).
 .
 3.4. Notices
 .
 You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
 (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
 or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
 the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
 the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
 .
 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
 .
 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
 Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
 behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
 such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
 You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
 liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
 disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
 jurisdiction.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
 ---------------------------------------------------
 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
 be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
 Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
 or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
 recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
 .
 5. Termination
 --------------
 .
 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
 if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
 compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
 Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
 ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
 non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
 come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
 first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
 from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
 Your receipt of the notice.
 .
 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
 infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,

License: OFL-1.1
 PREAMBLE
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
 efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
 open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
 with others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
 names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
 however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
 requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
 to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
 .
 DEFINITIONS
 "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
 Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
 include source files, build scripts and documentation.
 .
 "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
 copyright statement(s).
 .
 "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
 distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
 .
 "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
 or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
 Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
 new environment.
 .
 "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
 writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
 .

 binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

 Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
 Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
 Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
 permission.
 .
 5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
 must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
 distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
