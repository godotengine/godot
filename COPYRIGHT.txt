# Exhaustive licensing information for files in the Godot Engine repository
# =========================================================================
#
# This file aims at documenting the copyright and license for every source
# file in the Godot Engine repository, and especially outline the files
# whose license differs from the MIT/Expat license used by Godot Engine.
#
# It is written as a machine-readable format following the debian/copyright
# specification. Globbing patterns (e.g. "Files: *") mean that they affect
# all corresponding files (also recursively in subfolders), apart from those
# with a more explicit copyright statement.
#
# Licenses are given with their debian/copyright short name (or SPDX identifier
# if no standard short name exists) and are all included in plain text at the
# end of this file (in alphabetical order).
#
# Disclaimer for thirdparty libraries:
# ------------------------------------
#
# Licensing details for thirdparty libraries in the 'thirdparty/' directory
# are given in summarized form, i.e. with only the "main" license described
# in the library's license statement. Different licenses of single files or
# code snippets in thirdparty libraries are not documented here.
# For example:
#   Files: ./thirdparty/zlib/
#   Copyright: 1995-2017, Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler
#   License: Zlib
# The exact copyright for each file in that library *may* differ, and some
# files or code snippets might be distributed under other compatible licenses
# (e.g. a public domain dedication), but as far as Godot Engine is concerned
# the library is considered as a whole under the Zlib license.
#
# Nota: When linking dynamically against thirdparty libraries instead of
# building them into the Godot binary, you may remove the corresponding
# license details from this file.

 License
 .
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
 TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY

 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
 CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
 a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
 other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative
 work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or
 artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic
 adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
 transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from
 the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not
 be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the
 avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
 phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a
 moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the
 purpose of this License.
 .
 b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such
 as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
 broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in
 Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of
 their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is
 included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
 contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in
 themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work
 that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as
 defined above) for the purposes of this License.
 .
 c.  "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
 copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other
 transfer of ownership.
 .
 d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
 offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
 .
 e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
 the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or
 if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in
 addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
 musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
 play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
 expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
 being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
 performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
 organization that transmits the broadcast.
 .
 f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
 terms of this License including without limitation any production in the
 literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
 form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet
 and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same
 nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or
 entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words;
 a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a
 process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,
 architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work
 to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
 photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch
 or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
 architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a
 compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable
 work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent
 it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
 .
 g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
 License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
 respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
 Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
 violation.
 .
 h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work
 and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means
 or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
 performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
 members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place
 individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any
 means or process and the communication to the public of the performances
 of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and
 rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
 .
 i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
 without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
 fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
 protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
 medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
 Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
 Collections;
 .
 b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
 Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable
 steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes
 were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be
 marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
 modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 .
 c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
 in Collections; and,
 .
 d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
 e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
 i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
 which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
 licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
 right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
 granted under this License;
 .
 ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
 the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
 licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right
 to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
 under this License; and,
 .
 iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
 royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
 member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
 schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
 granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
 of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
 Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
 Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
 the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
 recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
 under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You
 must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
 disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
 Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You
 may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
 restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the
 rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
 Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but
 this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
 made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
 upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
 remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
 requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor
 You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
 credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
 .
 b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
 Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
 Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
 provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
 name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
 and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
 parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
 attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
 terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
 parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
 reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
 associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
 copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) ,
 consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
 identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
 translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
 original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section
 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
 that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit
 will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
 or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at
 least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.
 For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
 Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
 by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
 explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
 endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,
 as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
 express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
 Attribution Parties.
 .
 c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
 otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
 Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations
 or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
 derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to
 the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
 jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted
 in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
 deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
 action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
 Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
 fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
 to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
 (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
 WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
 EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
 Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
 from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
 terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
 compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
 survive any termination of this License.
 .
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
 is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
 Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
 any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
 withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
 required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
 License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
 stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
 Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
 on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
 this License.
 .
 b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
 offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms
 and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 .
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
 the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
 by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
 the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
 enforceable.
 .
 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
 breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
 and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This
 License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
 respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
 agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
 here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
 appear in any communication from You.
 .
 e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement
 of the Licensor and You.
 .
 f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
 License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
 for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
 September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
 Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and
 the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These
 rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in
 which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the
 corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty
 provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of
 rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights
 not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be
 included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the
 license of any rights under applicable law.

 Introduction
 ============
 .
 The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
 some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
 various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
 FreeType Project.
 .
 This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
 which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
 affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
 documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
 .
 This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
 (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
 and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
 alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
 .
   o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
     interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
 .
   o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
     full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
 .
   o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
     it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
     somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
     FreeType code. (`credits')
 .
 We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
 software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
 We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
 assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.

 Legal Terms
 ===========
 .
 0. Definitions
 --------------
 .
 Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
 and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
 distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
 Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
 beta or final release.
 .
 `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
 `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
 code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
 This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
 engine'.
 .
 This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
 FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
 documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
 original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
 If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
 this license, you must contact us to verify this.
 .
 The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
 Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
 specified below.
 .
 1. No Warranty
 --------------
 .
 THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
 WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
 BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
 USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
 .
 2. Redistribution
 -----------------
 .
 This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
 irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
 display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
 sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
 forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
 authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
 herein, subject to the following conditions:
 .
   o Redistribution  of source code  must retain this  license file
     (`LICENSE.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes
     to   the  original   files  must   be  clearly   indicated  in
     accompanying  documentation.   The  copyright notices  of  the
     unaltered, original  files must be preserved in  all copies of
     source files.
 .
   o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
     states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
     FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
     encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
     documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
 .
 These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
 the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
 our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
 to us.
 .
 3. Advertising
 --------------
 .
 Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
 the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
 purposes without specific prior written permission.

 We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
 following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
 or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
 `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
 .
 As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
 accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
 material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
 authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
 Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
 Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
 of this license.

License: LGPL-2.1+SLE (libwebsockets)
 Libwebsockets and included programs are provided under the terms of the GNU
 Library General Public License (LGPL) 2.1, with the following exceptions:
 .
 1) Any reference, whether in these modifications or in the GNU
 Library General Public License 2.1, to this License, these terms, the
 GNU Lesser Public License,  GNU Library General Public License, LGPL, or
 any similar reference shall refer to the GNU Library General Public
 License 2.1 as modified by these paragraphs 1) through 4).
 .
 2) Static linking of programs with the libwebsockets library does not
 constitute a derivative work and does not require the author to provide
 source code for the program, use the shared libwebsockets libraries, or
 link their program against a user-supplied version of libwebsockets.
 .
 If you link the program to a modified version of libwebsockets, then the
 changes to libwebsockets must be provided under the terms of the LGPL in
 sections 1, 2, and 4.
 .
 3) You do not have to provide a copy of the libwebsockets license with
 programs that are linked to the libwebsockets library, nor do you have to
 identify the libwebsockets license in your program or documentation as
 required by section 6 of the LGPL.
 .
 However, programs must still identify their use of libwebsockets. The
 following example statement can be included in user documentation to
 satisfy this requirement:
 .
 "[program] is based in part on the work of the libwebsockets  project
 (https://libwebsockets.org)"
 .

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                        Version 2.1, February 1999
 .
  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
  the version number 2.1.]
 .
                             Preamble
 .
   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 .
   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
 specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
 Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
 can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
 this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
 strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
 .
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
 not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
 for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
 it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
 it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
 these things.
 .
   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
 rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
 you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
 .
   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
 complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
 with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 .
   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
 library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
 .
   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
 there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
 modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
 that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
 author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
 introduced by others.
 .
   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
 any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
 effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
 restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
 any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
 consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
 .
   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
 ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
 General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
 is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
 this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
 libraries into non-free programs.
 .
   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
 a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
 combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
 General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
 entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
 Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
 the library.
 .
   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
 does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
 Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
 of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
 are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
 libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
 special circumstances.
 .
   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
 encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
 a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
 allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
 library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
 case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
 software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
 .
   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
 programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
 free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
 non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
 operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
 system.
 .
   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
 users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
 linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
 that program using a modified version of the Library.
 .
   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
 "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
 former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
 be combined with the library in order to run.
 .
                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
 program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
 other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
 this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
 Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 .
   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
 .
   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
 which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
 Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
 included without limitation in the term "modification".)
 .
   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
 and installation of the library.
 .
   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
 and what the program that uses the Library does.
 .
   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
 Library.
 .
   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
 fee.
 .
   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
 .
     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 .
     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
 .
     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
     in the event an application does not supply such function or
     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
     its purpose remains meaningful.
 .
     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
     root function must still compute square roots.)
 .
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
 it.
 .
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Library.
 .
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.
 .
   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
 these notices.
 .
   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
 .
   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
 the Library into a program that is not a library.
 .
   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
 medium customarily used for software interchange.
 .
   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 .
   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
 linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
 .
   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
 contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
 library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
 .
   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
 .
   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
 Library will still fall under Section 6.)
 .
   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
 .
   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
 link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
 modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
 engineering for debugging such modifications.
 .
   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
 of these things:
 .
     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
     to use the modified definitions.)
 .
     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
 .
     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
     least three years, to give the same user the materials
     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
     than the cost of performing this distribution.
 .
     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
     specified materials from the same place.
 .
     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
 .
   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
 Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
 the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 the executable.
 .
   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
 distribute.
 .
   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
 .
     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
     Sections above.
 .
     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 .
   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 .
   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Library or works based on it.
 .
   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
 this License.
 .
   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
 .
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 .
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.
 .
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 .
   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
 an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
 so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
 excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
 written in the body of this License.
 .
   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
 versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
 "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
 the Free Software Foundation.
 .
   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
 and reuse of software generally.
 .
                             NO WARRANTY
 .
   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES.
 .
                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
 .
   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
 ordinary General Public License).
 .
   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
 safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
 "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 .
     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
 .
     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     Lesser General Public License for more details.
 .
     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 .
   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
   library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
 .
   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990

 Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
 non-exclusive license:
 .
 (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
     Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
     modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
     Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or

 become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
 distributes such Contribution.
 .
 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
 .
 The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
 this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
 distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
 Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
 Contributor:
 .
 (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
     or
 .
 (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
     Version); or
 .
 (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
     its Contributions.
 .
 This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
 or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
 the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
 .
 2.4. Subsequent Licenses
 .
 No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
 distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
 License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
 permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
 .
 2.5. Representation
 .
 Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
 Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
 to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
 .
 2.6. Fair Use
 .
 This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
 applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
 equivalents.
 .
 2.7. Conditions
 .
 Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
 in Section 2.1.
 .
 3. Responsibilities
 -------------------
 .
 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
 .
 All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
 Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
 the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
 Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
 License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
 attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
 Form.
 .
 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
 .
 If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
 .
 (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
 .
 (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
 .
 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
 .
 You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
 provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
 the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
 Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
 Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
 License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
 under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
 the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
 Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
 License(s).
 .
 3.4. Notices
 .
 You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
 (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
 or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
 the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
 the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
 .
 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
 .
 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
 Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
 behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
 such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
 You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
 liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
 disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
 jurisdiction.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
 ---------------------------------------------------
 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
 be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
 Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
 or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
 recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
 .
 5. Termination
 --------------
 .
 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
 if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
 compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
 Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
 ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
 non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
 come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
 first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
 from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
 Your receipt of the notice.
 .
 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
 infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
 counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
 directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
 You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
 .
 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
 end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
 have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
 prior to termination shall survive termination.

 PREAMBLE
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
 efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
 open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
 with others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
 names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
 however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
 requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
 to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
 .
 DEFINITIONS
 "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
 Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
 include source files, build scripts and documentation.
 .

 copyright statement(s).
 .
 "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
 distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
 .

 new environment.
