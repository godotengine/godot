Comment:
 Exhaustive licensing information for files in the Godot Engine repository
 =========================================================================
 .
 This file aims at documenting the copyright and license for every source
 file in the Godot Engine repository, and especially outline the files
 whose license differs from the MIT/Expat license used by Godot Engine.
 .
 It is written as a machine-readable format following the debian/copyright
 specification. Globbing patterns (e.g. "Files: *") mean that they affect
 all corresponding files (also recursively in subfolders), apart from those
 with a more explicit copyright statement.
 .
 Licenses are given with their debian/copyright short name (or SPDX identifier
 if no standard short name exists) and are all included in plain text at the
 end of this file (in alphabetical order).
 .
 Disclaimer for thirdparty libraries:
 ------------------------------------
 .
 Licensing details for thirdparty libraries in the 'thirdparty/' directory
 are given in summarized form, i.e. with only the "main" license described
 in the library's license statement. Different licenses of single files or
 code snippets in thirdparty libraries are not documented here.
 For example:
   Files: thirdparty/zlib/*
   Copyright: 1995-2017, Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler
   License: Zlib
 The exact copyright for each file in that library *may* differ, and some
 files or code snippets might be distributed under other compatible licenses
 (e.g. a public domain dedication), but as far as Godot Engine is concerned
 the library is considered as a whole under the Zlib license.
 .
 Note: When linking dynamically against thirdparty libraries instead of
 building them into the Godot binary, you may remove the corresponding
 license details from this file.

    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
 .
    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
    subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 .
 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 .
 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.
 .
 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:
 .
 (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
     Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 .
 (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
     stating that You changed the files; and
 .
 (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
     that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
     attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
     excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
     the Derivative Works; and
 .
 (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
     distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
     include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
     within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
     pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
     of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
     as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
     documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
     within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
     wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
     of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
     do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
     notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
     or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
     that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
     as modifying the License.
 .
 You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 the conditions stated in this License.
 .
 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 .
 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 .
 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 .
 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 .
 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

License: CC0-1.0
 CC0 1.0 Universal
 .
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
 subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
 authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
 purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
 works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
 claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
 and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
 purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
 contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
 further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
 reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
 efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
 of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
 Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
 and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
 and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
 effect of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
 Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
 to, the following:
 .
 i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
 and translate a Work;
 .
 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 .
 iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
 depicted in a Work;
 .
 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
 subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 .
 v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
 a Work;
 .
 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
 European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
 protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
 including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
 .
 vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
 based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
 applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
 unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
 and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
 known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
 action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
 duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
 extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
 copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
 commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
 the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
 detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
 shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
 any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
 by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
 judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
 shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
 Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
 is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
 non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
 unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
 the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
 provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
 in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
 purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
 promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
 of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
 License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
 applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
 invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
 affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
 and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
 Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
 surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 .
 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
 of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
 including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
 for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
 other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
 discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 .
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
 that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
 any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
 disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
 or other rights required for any use of the Work.
 .
 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
 party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
 CC0 or use of the Work.

License: CC-BY-4.0
 Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License
 .
 By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
 to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
 Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public
 License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
 contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
 acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You
 such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
 making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
 conditions.
 .
 Section 1 -- Definitions.
 .
 a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
 Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
 and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
 arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
 permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
 Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
 Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
 Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
 synched in timed relation with a moving image.
 .
 b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
 and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
 accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
 closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
 performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
 Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
 categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
 specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
 Rights.
 .
 d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
 absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
 fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
 Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
 agreements.
 .
 e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
 any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
 that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
 .
 f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
 or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
 License.
 .
 g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
 terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
 all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
 Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
 .
 h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
 under this Public License.
 .
 i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
 process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
 as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
 dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
 available to the public including in ways that members of the
 public may access the material from a place and at a time
 individually chosen by them.
 .
 j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
 resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
 the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
 as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
 equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
 .
 k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
 under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
 .
 Section 2 -- Scope.
 .
 a. License grant.
 .
 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
 the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
 non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
 exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
 .
 a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
 in part; and
 .
 b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 .
 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
 Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
 License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
 its terms and conditions.
 .
 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
 6(a).
 .
 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
 Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
 all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
 and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
 Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
 authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
 necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
 technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
 Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
 simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
 (4) never produces Adapted Material.
 .
 5. Downstream recipients.
 .
 a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
 recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
 receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
 Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
 Public License.
 .
 b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
 any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
 apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
 Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
 Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
 Material.
 .
 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
 may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
 are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
 with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
 the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
 provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
 b. Other rights.
 .
 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
 licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
 privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
 the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
 assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
 extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
 Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
 Public License.
 .
 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
 collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
 Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
 under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
 licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
 reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 Section 3 -- License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
 a. Attribution.
 .
 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
 form), You must:
 .
 a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
 with the Licensed Material:
 .
 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
 Material and any others designated to receive
 attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
 the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
 designated);
 .
 ii. a copyright notice;
 .
 iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 .
 iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
 warranties;
 .
 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
 extent reasonably practicable;
 .

 retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
 c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
 Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
 hyperlink to, this Public License.
 .
 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
 reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
 which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
 reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
 hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
 information.
 .
 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
 information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
 reasonably practicable.
 .
 4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
 License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
 Material from complying with this Public License.
 .
 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
 a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
 to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
 portion of the contents of the database;
 .
 b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
 contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
 Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
 Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
 .
 c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
 all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
 a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
 EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
 AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
 ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
 IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
 WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
 ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
 KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
 ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
 TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
 NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
 COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
 USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
 ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
 DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
 IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
 above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
 possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
 waiver of all liability.
 .
 Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
 .
 a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
 Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
 this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
 terminate automatically.
 .
 b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
 Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
 it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
 violation; or
 .
 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
 right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
 of this Public License.
 .
 c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
 Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
 distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
 will not terminate this Public License.
 .
 d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
 License.
 .
 Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
 a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
 terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 .
 b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
 Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
 independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 Section 8 -- Interpretation.
 .
 a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
 shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
 conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
 be made without permission under this Public License.
 .
 b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
 deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
 minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
 cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
 without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
 conditions.
 .
 c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
 failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
 Licensor.
 .
 d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
 as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
 that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
 processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

 using tools of your choice, without using bison or any bison files.
 .
 Other parts, outside of glslang proper, include:
 .
 - gl_types.h, only needed for OpenGL-like reflection, and can be left out of
   a parse and codegen project.  See it for its license.
 .
 - update_glslang_sources.py, which is not part of the project proper and does
   not need to be used.
 .
 - the SPIR-V "remapper", which is optional, but has the same license as
   glslang proper
 .
 - Google tests and SPIR-V tools, and anything in the external subdirectory
   are external and optional; see them for their respective licenses.

 Introduction
 ============
 .
 The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
 some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
 various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
 FreeType Project.
 .
 This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
 which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
 affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
 documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
 .
 This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
 (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
 and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
 alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
 .
   o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
     interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
 .
   o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
     full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
 .
   o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
     it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
     somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
     FreeType code. (`credits')
 .
 We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
 software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
 We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
 assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
 .
 .
 Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
 credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
 encourage you to use the following text:
 .
  """
   Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
   Project (https://freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
  """
 .
 Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
 actually use.

 .
 Legal Terms
 ===========
 .
 0. Definitions
 --------------
 .
 Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
 and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
 distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
 Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
 beta or final release.
 .
 `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
 `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
 code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
 This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
 engine'.
 .
 This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
 FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
 documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
 original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
 If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
 this license, you must contact us to verify this.
 .
 The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
 Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
 specified below.
 .
 1. No Warranty
 --------------
 .
 THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
 WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
 BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
 USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
 .
 2. Redistribution
 -----------------
 .
 This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
 irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
 display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
 sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
 forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
 authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
 herein, subject to the following conditions:
 .
   o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
     (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
     the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
     documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
     original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
     files.
 .
   o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
     states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
     FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
     encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
     documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
 .
 These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
 the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
 our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
 to us.
 .
 3. Advertising
 --------------
 .
 Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
 the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
 purposes without specific prior written permission.
 .
 We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
 following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
 or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
 `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
 .
 As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
 accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
 material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
 authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
 Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
 Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
 of this license.
 .

     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
     Version); or
 .

 applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
 equivalents.
 .
 2.7. Conditions
 .
 Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted

 .
 3. Responsibilities
 -------------------
 .
 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
 .
 All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
 Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
 the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
 Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
 License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
 attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
 Form.
 .
 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
 .
 If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
 .
 (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
 .
 (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
 .
 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
 .
 You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
 provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
 the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
 Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
 Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
 License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
 under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
 the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
 Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
 License(s).
 .
 3.4. Notices
 .
 You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
 (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
 or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
 the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
 the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
 .
 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
 .
 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
 Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
 behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
 such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
 You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
 liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
 disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
 jurisdiction.
 .
 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
 ---------------------------------------------------
 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
 be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
 Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
 or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
 recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
 .
 5. Termination
 --------------
 .
 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
 if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
 compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
 Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
 ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
 non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
 come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
 first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
 from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
 Your receipt of the notice.
 .
 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
 infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
 counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
 directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
 You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
 .
 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
 end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
 have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
 prior to termination shall survive termination.
 .

License: OFL-1.1
 PREAMBLE
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
 efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
 open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
 with others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
 names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
 however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
 requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
 to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
 .
 DEFINITIONS
 "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
 Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
 include source files, build scripts and documentation.
 .
 "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
 copyright statement(s).
 .
 "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
 distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
 .
 "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
 or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
 Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
 new environment.
 .
 "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
 writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
 .

 redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
 Software, subject to the following conditions:

 1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
 in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

 binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
 .
 3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
 Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
 Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
 presented to the users.

 4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
 Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
 Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
 Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
 permission.
 .
 5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
 must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
 distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
 remain under this license does not apply to any document created
