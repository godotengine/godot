// to find out Microsoft deprecated half the API and its replacement is as confusing
// as they could make it. Joey suggested looking into libuvc which offers a more direct
// route to webcams over USB and this is very promising but it wouldn't compile on
// windows for me...I've gutted the classes I implemented DirectShow in just to have
// a skeleton for someone to work on, mail me for more details or if you want a copy....
