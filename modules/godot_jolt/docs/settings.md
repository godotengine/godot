      </td>
      <td>
        When disabled this will force a shape margin of 0, trading in performance for accuracy,
        which can make things like collision normals more intuitive.
        <br><br>This only applies to <code>BoxShape3D</code>, <code>CylinderShape3D</code> and
        <code>ConvexPolygonShape3D</code>. Other shape types do not utilize margins.

      <td>
        Whether or not to enable the enhanced internal edge removal, which means that extra effort
        will be made to try to remove collisions with internal edges of
        <code>ConcavePolygonShape3D</code> and <code>HeightMapShape3D</code>. This makes physics
        bodies move smoother over such shapes, at the cost of performance.
      </td>
      <td>
        Note that this applies to <code>RigidBody3D</code> as well as queries like
        <code>get_rest_info</code>, <code>move_and_collide</code> and <code>move_and_slide</code>.

        overlap with complex static geometry, such as <code>ConcavePolygonShape3D</code> or
        <code>HeightMapShape3D</code>.
        <br><br>It is strongly recommended that you set up your collision layers and masks in such a

        ⚠️ Much like the "Areas Detect Static Bodies" setting, this setting can come at a heavy
        performance and memory cost if you allow many/large frozen kinematic bodies with a non-zero
        <code>max_contacts_reported</code> to overlap with complex static geometry, such as
        <code>ConcavePolygonShape3D</code> or <code>HeightMapShape3D</code>.

      <td>
        ⚠️ The default value for this setting, "Node A", differs from how this behaves in Godot
        Physics, where this is effectively "Node B" instead.
        <br><br>If you need 1-body joints to behave
        like they do in Godot Physics then change this to "Node B". Note that this can result in
        strange and unintuitive behavior when combining linear and angular degrees-of-freedom for
        the 6DOF joint.

        <code>get_collision_face_index()</code> in the <code>RayCast3D</code> node.
      </td>
      <td>
        ⚠️ Enabling this can come at a fairly heavy memory cost if you have many (or complex)
        <code>ConcavePolygonShape3D</code> in your scene, as this roughly adds an additional 25%
        memory.

        The cut-off angle for the active edge detection.

        This angle determines whether or not an edge between two triangles in either a
        <code>ConcavePolygonShape3D</code> or <code>HeightMapShape3D</code> will be considered
        "active" or "inactive", where contact with an inactive edge will have its normal overridden
        to instead be the surface normal of the triangle.
        <br><br>Setting this too low can result in ghost collisions. Setting this too high can
        result in things like <code>RigidBody3D</code> sinking into triangle edges or
        <code>move_and_slide</code> behaving in weird ways when going over or pressing up against
        triangle edges.

        Removal" setting.
