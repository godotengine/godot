		A 2D CSG mesh shape.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A 2D CSG node that allows creating a shape for the 2D CSG system based on the geometry of a 2D rendering mesh resource.
		[b]Performance:[/b] CSG nodes are only intended for prototyping as they have a significant CPU performance cost. Consider baking final CSG operation results into static geometry that replaces the CSG nodes. This can be done using the various [b]Bake[/b] options available in the [b]CSG2D[/b] menu at the top of the 2D editor viewport after selecting a 2D CSG node.
