	<methods>
		<method name="Color8">
			<return type="Color" />
			<param index="0" name="r8" type="int" />
			<param index="1" name="g8" type="int" />
			<param index="2" name="b8" type="int" />
			<param index="3" name="a8" type="int" default="255" />
			<description>
				Returns a [Color] constructed from red ([param r8]), green ([param g8]), blue ([param b8]), and optionally alpha ([param a8]) integer channels, each divided by [code]255.0[/code] for their final value. Using [method Color8] instead of the standard [Color] constructor is useful when you need to match exact color values in an [Image].
				[codeblock]
				var red = Color8(255, 0, 0)             # Same as Color(1, 0, 0).
				var dark_blue = Color8(0, 0, 51)        # Same as Color(0, 0, 0.2).
				var my_color = Color8(306, 255, 0, 102) # Same as Color(1.2, 1, 0, 0.4).
				[/codeblock]
				[b]Note:[/b] Due to the lower precision of [method Color8] compared to the standard [Color] constructor, a color created with [method Color8] will generally not be equal to the same color created with the standard [Color] constructor. Use [method Color.is_equal_approx] for comparisons to avoid issues with floating-point precision error.

		<method name="assert">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="condition" type="bool" />
			<param index="1" name="message" type="String" default="&quot;&quot;" />
			<description>
				Asserts that the [param condition] is [code]true[/code]. If the [param condition] is [code]false[/code], an error is generated. When running from the editor, the running project will also be paused until you resume it. This can be used as a stronger form of [method @GlobalScope.push_error] for reporting errors to project developers or add-on users.
				An optional [param message] can be shown in addition to the generic "Assertion failed" message. You can use this to provide additional details about why the assertion failed.
				[b]Warning:[/b] For performance reasons, the code inside [method assert] is only executed in debug builds or when running the project from the editor. Don't include code that has side effects in an [method assert] call. Otherwise, the project will behave differently when exported in release mode.
				[codeblock]
				# Imagine we always want speed to be between 0 and 20.
				var speed = -10
				assert(speed &lt; 20) # True, the program will continue.
				assert(speed &gt;= 0) # False, the program will stop.
				assert(speed &gt;= 0 and speed &lt; 20) # You can also combine the two conditional statements in one check.
				assert(speed &lt; 20, "the speed limit is 20") # Show a message.
				[/codeblock]
				[b]Note:[/b] [method assert] is a keyword, not a function. So you cannot access it as a [Callable] or use it inside expressions.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="char">
			<return type="String" />
			<param index="0" name="char" type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns a single character (as a [String]) of the given Unicode code point (which is compatible with ASCII code).
				[codeblock]
				a = char(65)      # a is "A"
				a = char(65 + 32) # a is "a"
				a = char(8364)    # a is "€"
				[/codeblock]

		<method name="convert" is_deprecated="true">
			<return type="Variant" />
			<param index="0" name="what" type="Variant" />
			<param index="1" name="type" type="int" />
			<description>
				[i]Deprecated.[/i] Use [method @GlobalScope.type_convert] instead.
				Converts [param what] to [param type] in the best way possible. The [param type] uses the [enum Variant.Type] values.
				[codeblock]
				var a = [4, 2.5, 1.2]
				print(a is Array) # Prints true

				var b = convert(a, TYPE_PACKED_BYTE_ARRAY)
				print(b)          # Prints [4, 2, 1]
				print(b is Array) # Prints false
				[/codeblock]
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="dict_to_inst">
			<return type="Object" />
			<param index="0" name="dictionary" type="Dictionary" />
			<description>
				Converts a [param dictionary] (created with [method inst_to_dict]) back to an Object instance. Can be useful for deserializing.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_stack">
			<return type="Array" />
			<description>
				Returns an array of dictionaries representing the current call stack. See also [method print_stack].
				[codeblock]
				func _ready():
				    foo()

				func foo():
				    bar()

				func bar():
				    print(get_stack())
				[/codeblock]
				Starting from [code]_ready()[/code], [code]bar()[/code] would print:
				[codeblock]
				[{function:bar, line:12, source:res://script.gd}, {function:foo, line:9, source:res://script.gd}, {function:_ready, line:6, source:res://script.gd}]
				[/codeblock]
				[b]Note:[/b] This function only works if the running instance is connected to a debugging server (i.e. an editor instance). [method get_stack] will not work in projects exported in release mode, or in projects exported in debug mode if not connected to a debugging server.
				[b]Note:[/b] Calling this function from a [Thread] is not supported. Doing so will return an empty array.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="inst_to_dict">
			<return type="Dictionary" />
			<param index="0" name="instance" type="Object" />
			<description>
				Returns the passed [param instance] converted to a Dictionary. Can be useful for serializing.
				[b]Note:[/b] Cannot be used to serialize objects with built-in scripts attached or objects allocated within built-in scripts.
				[codeblock]
				var foo = "bar"
				func _ready():
				    var d = inst_to_dict(self)
				    print(d.keys())
				    print(d.values())
				[/codeblock]
				Prints out:
				[codeblock]
				[@subpath, @path, foo]
				[, res://test.gd, bar]
				[/codeblock]
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_instance_of">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="value" type="Variant" />
			<param index="1" name="type" type="Variant" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if [param value] is an instance of [param type]. The [param type] value must be one of the following:
				- A constant from the [enum Variant.Type] enumeration, for example [constant TYPE_INT].
				- An [Object]-derived class which exists in [ClassDB], for example [Node].
				- A [Script] (you can use any class, including inner one).
				Unlike the right operand of the [code]is[/code] operator, [param type] can be a non-constant value. The [code]is[/code] operator supports more features (such as typed arrays). Use the operator instead of this method if you do not need dynamic type checking.
				Examples:
				[codeblock]
				print(is_instance_of(a, TYPE_INT))
				print(is_instance_of(a, Node))
				print(is_instance_of(a, MyClass))
				print(is_instance_of(a, MyClass.InnerClass))
				[/codeblock]
				[b]Note:[/b] If [param value] and/or [param type] are freed objects (see [method @GlobalScope.is_instance_valid]), or [param type] is not one of the above options, this method will raise a runtime error.
				See also [method @GlobalScope.typeof], [method type_exists], [method Array.is_same_typed] (and other [Array] methods).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="len">
			<return type="int" />
			<param index="0" name="var" type="Variant" />
			<description>
				Returns the length of the given Variant [param var]. The length can be the character count of a [String], the element count of any array type or the size of a [Dictionary]. For every other Variant type, a run-time error is generated and execution is stopped.
				[codeblock]
				a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
				len(a) # Returns 4

				b = "Hello!"
				len(b) # Returns 6
				[/codeblock]
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="load">
			<return type="Resource" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns a [Resource] from the filesystem located at the absolute [param path]. Unless it's already referenced elsewhere (such as in another script or in the scene), the resource is loaded from disk on function call, which might cause a slight delay, especially when loading large scenes. To avoid unnecessary delays when loading something multiple times, either store the resource in a variable or use [method preload].
				[b]Note:[/b] Resource paths can be obtained by right-clicking on a resource in the FileSystem dock and choosing "Copy Path", or by dragging the file from the FileSystem dock into the current script.
				[codeblock]
				# Load a scene called "main" located in the root of the project directory and cache it in a variable.
				var main = load("res://main.tscn") # main will contain a PackedScene resource.
				[/codeblock]
				[b]Important:[/b] Relative paths are [i]not[/i] relative to the script calling this method, instead it is prefixed with [code]"res://"[/code]. Loading from relative paths might not work as expected.
				This function is a simplified version of [method ResourceLoader.load], which can be used for more advanced scenarios.
				[b]Note:[/b] Files have to be imported into the engine first to load them using this function. If you want to load [Image]s at run-time, you may use [method Image.load]. If you want to import audio files, you can use the snippet described in [member AudioStreamMP3.data].
				[b]Note:[/b] If [member ProjectSettings.editor/export/convert_text_resources_to_binary] is [code]true[/code], [method @GDScript.load] will not be able to read converted files in an exported project. If you rely on run-time loading of files present within the PCK, set [member ProjectSettings.editor/export/convert_text_resources_to_binary] to [code]false[/code].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="preload">
			<return type="Resource" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns a [Resource] from the filesystem located at [param path]. During run-time, the resource is loaded when the script is being parsed. This function effectively acts as a reference to that resource. Note that this function requires [param path] to be a constant [String]. If you want to load a resource from a dynamic/variable path, use [method load].
				[b]Note:[/b] Resource paths can be obtained by right-clicking on a resource in the Assets Panel and choosing "Copy Path", or by dragging the file from the FileSystem dock into the current script.
				[codeblock]
				# Create instance of a scene.
				var diamond = preload("res://diamond.tscn").instantiate()
				[/codeblock]
				[b]Note:[/b] [method preload] is a keyword, not a function. So you cannot access it as a [Callable].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="print_debug" qualifiers="vararg">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Like [method @GlobalScope.print], but includes the current stack frame when running with the debugger turned on.
				The output in the console may look like the following:
				[codeblock]
				Test print
				At: res://test.gd:15:_process()
				[/codeblock]
				[b]Note:[/b] Calling this function from a [Thread] is not supported. Doing so will instead print the thread ID.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="print_stack">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Prints a stack trace at the current code location. See also [method get_stack].
				The output in the console may look like the following:
				[codeblock]
				Frame 0 - res://test.gd:16 in function '_process'
				[/codeblock]
				[b]Note:[/b] This function only works if the running instance is connected to a debugging server (i.e. an editor instance). [method print_stack] will not work in projects exported in release mode, or in projects exported in debug mode if not connected to a debugging server.
				[b]Note:[/b] Calling this function from a [Thread] is not supported. Doing so will instead print the thread ID.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="range" qualifiers="vararg">
			<return type="Array" />
			<description>
				Returns an array with the given range. [method range] can be called in three ways:
				[code]range(n: int)[/code]: Starts from 0, increases by steps of 1, and stops [i]before[/i] [code]n[/code]. The argument [code]n[/code] is [b]exclusive[/b].
				[code]range(b: int, n: int)[/code]: Starts from [code]b[/code], increases by steps of 1, and stops [i]before[/i] [code]n[/code]. The arguments [code]b[/code] and [code]n[/code] are [b]inclusive[/b] and [b]exclusive[/b], respectively.
				[code]range(b: int, n: int, s: int)[/code]: Starts from [code]b[/code], increases/decreases by steps of [code]s[/code], and stops [i]before[/i] [code]n[/code]. The arguments [code]b[/code] and [code]n[/code] are [b]inclusive[/b] and [b]exclusive[/b], respectively. The argument [code]s[/code] [b]can[/b] be negative, but not [code]0[/code]. If [code]s[/code] is [code]0[/code], an error message is printed.
				[method range] converts all arguments to [int] before processing.
				[b]Note:[/b] Returns an empty array if no value meets the value constraint (e.g. [code]range(2, 5, -1)[/code] or [code]range(5, 5, 1)[/code]).
				Examples:
				[codeblock]
				print(range(4))        # Prints [0, 1, 2, 3]
				print(range(2, 5))     # Prints [2, 3, 4]
				print(range(0, 6, 2))  # Prints [0, 2, 4]
				print(range(4, 1, -1)) # Prints [4, 3, 2]
				[/codeblock]
				To iterate over an [Array] backwards, use:
				[codeblock]
				var array = [3, 6, 9]
				for i in range(array.size() - 1, -1, -1):
				    print(array[i])
				[/codeblock]
				Output:
				[codeblock]
				9
				6
				3
				[/codeblock]
				To iterate over [float], convert them in the loop.
				[codeblock]
				for i in range (3, 0, -1):
				    print(i / 10.0)
				[/codeblock]
				Output:
				[codeblock]
				0.3
				0.2
				0.1
				[/codeblock]
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="type_exists">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="type" type="StringName" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the given [Object]-derived class exists in [ClassDB]. Note that [Variant] data types are not registered in [ClassDB].
				[codeblock]
				type_exists("Sprite2D") # Returns true
				type_exists("NonExistentClass") # Returns false
				[/codeblock]

		<constant name="PI" value="3.14159265358979">
			Constant that represents how many times the diameter of a circle fits around its perimeter. This is equivalent to [code]TAU / 2[/code], or 180 degrees in rotations.
		</constant>
		<constant name="TAU" value="6.28318530717959">
			The circle constant, the circumference of the unit circle in radians. This is equivalent to [code]PI * 2[/code], or 360 degrees in rotations.
		</constant>
		<constant name="INF" value="inf">
			Positive floating-point infinity. This is the result of floating-point division when the divisor is [code]0.0[/code]. For negative infinity, use [code]-INF[/code]. Dividing by [code]-0.0[/code] will result in negative infinity if the numerator is positive, so dividing by [code]0.0[/code] is not the same as dividing by [code]-0.0[/code] (despite [code]0.0 == -0.0[/code] returning [code]true[/code]).
			[b]Warning:[/b] Numeric infinity is only a concept with floating-point numbers, and has no equivalent for integers. Dividing an integer number by [code]0[/code] will not result in [constant INF] and will result in a run-time error instead.
		</constant>
		<constant name="NAN" value="nan">
			"Not a Number", an invalid floating-point value. [constant NAN] has special properties, including that [code]!=[/code] always returns [code]true[/code], while other comparison operators always return [code]false[/code]. This is true even when comparing with itself ([code]NAN == NAN[/code] returns [code]false[/code] and [code]NAN != NAN[/code] returns [code]true[/code]). It is returned by some invalid operations, such as dividing floating-point [code]0.0[/code] by [code]0.0[/code].
			[b]Warning:[/b] "Not a Number" is only a concept with floating-point numbers, and has no equivalent for integers. Dividing an integer [code]0[/code] by [code]0[/code] will not result in [constant NAN] and will result in a run-time error instead.

				Define a new group for the following exported properties. This helps to organize properties in the Inspector dock. Groups can be added with an optional [param prefix], which would make group to only consider properties that have this prefix. The grouping will break on the first property that doesn't have a prefix. The prefix is also removed from the property's name in the Inspector dock.
				If no [param prefix] is provided, then every following property will be added to the group. The group ends when then next group or category is defined. You can also force end a group by using this annotation with empty strings for parameters, [code]@export_group("", "")[/code].
				Groups cannot be nested, use [annotation @export_subgroup] to add subgroups within groups.

			<description>
				Export an [int] or [float] property as a range value. The range must be defined by [param min] and [param max], as well as an optional [param step] and a variety of extra hints. The [param step] defaults to [code]1[/code] for integer properties. For floating-point numbers this value depends on your [code]EditorSettings.interface/inspector/default_float_step[/code] setting.
				If hints [code]"or_greater"[/code] and [code]"or_less"[/code] are provided, the editor widget will not cap the value at range boundaries. The [code]"exp"[/code] hint will make the edited values on range to change exponentially. The [code]"hide_slider"[/code] hint will hide the slider element of the editor widget.
				Hints also allow to indicate the units for the edited value. Using [code]"radians_as_degrees"[/code] you can specify that the actual value is in radians, but should be displayed in degrees in the Inspector dock (the range values are also in degrees). [code]"degrees"[/code] allows to add a degree sign as a unit suffix (the value is unchanged). Finally, a custom suffix can be provided using [code]"suffix:unit"[/code], where "unit" can be any string.
				See also [constant PROPERTY_HINT_RANGE].

			<description>
				Mark the following method for remote procedure calls. See [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html]High-level multiplayer[/url].
				If [param mode] is set as [code]"any_peer"[/code], allows any peer to call this RPC function. Otherwise, only the authority peer is allowed to call it and [param mode] should be kept as [code]"authority"[/code]. When configuring functions as RPCs with [method Node.rpc_config], each of these modes respectively corresponds to the [constant MultiplayerAPI.RPC_MODE_AUTHORITY] and [constant MultiplayerAPI.RPC_MODE_ANY_PEER] RPC modes. See [enum MultiplayerAPI.RPCMode]. If a peer that is not the authority tries to call a function that is only allowed for the authority, the function will not be executed. If the error can be detected locally (when the RPC configuration is consistent between the local and the remote peer), an error message will be displayed on the sender peer. Otherwise, the remote peer will detect the error and print an error there.
				If [param sync] is set as [code]"call_remote"[/code], the function will only be executed on the remote peer, but not locally. To run this function locally too, set [param sync] to [code]"call_local"[/code]. When configuring functions as RPCs with [method Node.rpc_config], this is equivalent to setting [code]call_local[/code] to [code]true[/code].
				The [param transfer_mode] accepted values are [code]"unreliable"[/code], [code]"unreliable_ordered"[/code], or [code]"reliable"[/code]. It sets the transfer mode of the underlying [MultiplayerPeer]. See [member MultiplayerPeer.transfer_mode].
				The [param transfer_channel] defines the channel of the underlying [MultiplayerPeer]. See [member MultiplayerPeer.transfer_channel].
				The order of [param mode], [param sync] and [param transfer_mode] does not matter, but values related to the same argument must not be used more than once. [param transfer_channel] always has to be the 4th argument (you must specify 3 preceding arguments).
