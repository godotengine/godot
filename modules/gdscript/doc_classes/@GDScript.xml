	<methods>
		<method name="Color8" deprecated="Use [method Color.from_rgba8] instead.">
			<return type="Color" />
			<param index="0" name="r8" type="int" />
			<param index="1" name="g8" type="int" />
			<param index="2" name="b8" type="int" />
			<param index="3" name="a8" type="int" default="255" />
			<description>
				Returns a [Color] constructed from red ([param r8]), green ([param g8]), blue ([param b8]), and optionally alpha ([param a8]) integer channels, each divided by [code]255.0[/code] for their final value. Using [method Color8] instead of the standard [Color] constructor is useful when you need to match exact color values in an [Image].
				[codeblock]
				var red = Color8(255, 0, 0)             # Same as Color(1, 0, 0).
				var dark_blue = Color8(0, 0, 51)        # Same as Color(0, 0, 0.2).
				var my_color = Color8(306, 255, 0, 102) # Same as Color(1.2, 1, 0, 0.4).
				[/codeblock]
				[b]Note:[/b] Due to the lower precision of [method Color8] compared to the standard [Color] constructor, a color created with [method Color8] will generally not be equal to the same color created with the standard [Color] constructor. Use [method Color.is_equal_approx] for comparisons to avoid issues with floating-point precision error.

		<method name="assert">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="condition" type="bool" />
			<param index="1" name="message" type="String" default="&quot;&quot;" />
			<description>
				Asserts that the [param condition] is [code]true[/code]. If the [param condition] is [code]false[/code], an error is generated. When running from the editor, the running project will also be paused until you resume it. This can be used as a stronger form of [method @GlobalScope.push_error] for reporting errors to project developers or add-on users.
				An optional [param message] can be shown in addition to the generic "Assertion failed" message. You can use this to provide additional details about why the assertion failed.
				[b]Warning:[/b] For performance reasons, the code inside [method assert] is only executed in debug builds or when running the project from the editor. Don't include code that has side effects in an [method assert] call. Otherwise, the project will behave differently when exported in release mode.
				[codeblock]
				# Imagine we always want speed to be between 0 and 20.
				var speed = -10
				assert(speed &lt; 20) # True, the program will continue.
				assert(speed &gt;= 0) # False, the program will stop.
				assert(speed &gt;= 0 and speed &lt; 20) # You can also combine the two conditional statements in one check.
				assert(speed &lt; 20, "the speed limit is 20") # Show a message.
				[/codeblock]
				[b]Note:[/b] [method assert] is a keyword, not a function. So you cannot access it as a [Callable] or use it inside expressions.
			</description>

		<method name="char">
			<return type="String" />
			<param index="0" name="code" type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns a single character (as a [String] of length 1) of the given Unicode code point [param code].
				[codeblock]
				print(char(65))     # Prints "A"
				print(char(129302)) # Prints "🤖" (robot face emoji)
				[/codeblock]
				This is the inverse of [method ord]. See also [method String.chr] and [method String.unicode_at].

		<method name="convert" deprecated="Use [method @GlobalScope.type_convert] instead.">
			<return type="Variant" />
			<param index="0" name="what" type="Variant" />
			<param index="1" name="type" type="int" enum="Variant.Type" />
			<description>
				Converts [param what] to [param type] in the best way possible. The [param type] uses the [enum Variant.Type] values.
				[codeblock]
				var a = [4, 2.5, 1.2]
				print(a is Array) # Prints true

				var b = convert(a, TYPE_PACKED_BYTE_ARRAY)
				print(b)          # Prints [4, 2, 1]
				print(b is Array) # Prints false
				[/codeblock]
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="dict_to_inst" deprecated="Consider using [method JSON.to_native] or [method Object.get_property_list] instead.">
			<return type="Object" />
			<param index="0" name="dictionary" type="Dictionary" />
			<description>
				Converts a [param dictionary] (created with [method inst_to_dict]) back to an Object instance. Can be useful for deserializing.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_stack">
			<return type="Array" />
			<description>
				Returns an array of dictionaries representing the current call stack.
				[codeblock]
				func _ready():
					foo()

				func foo():
					bar()

				func bar():
					print(get_stack())
				[/codeblock]
				Starting from [code]_ready()[/code], [code]bar()[/code] would print:
				[codeblock lang=text]
				[{function:bar, line:12, source:res://script.gd}, {function:foo, line:9, source:res://script.gd}, {function:_ready, line:6, source:res://script.gd}]
				[/codeblock]
				See also [method print_debug], [method print_stack], and [method Engine.capture_script_backtraces].
				[b]Note:[/b] By default, backtraces are only available in editor builds and debug builds. To enable them for release builds as well, you need to enable [member ProjectSettings.debug/settings/gdscript/always_track_call_stacks].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="inst_to_dict" deprecated="Consider using [method JSON.from_native] or [method Object.get_property_list] instead.">
			<return type="Dictionary" />
			<param index="0" name="instance" type="Object" />
			<description>
				Returns the passed [param instance] converted to a [Dictionary]. Can be useful for serializing.
				[codeblock]
				var foo = "bar"
				func _ready():
					var d = inst_to_dict(self)
					print(d.keys())
					print(d.values())
				[/codeblock]
				Prints out:
				[codeblock lang=text]
				[@subpath, @path, foo]
				[, res://test.gd, bar]
				[/codeblock]
				[b]Note:[/b] This function can only be used to serialize objects with an attached [GDScript] stored in a separate file. Objects without an attached script, with a script written in another language, or with a built-in script are not supported.
				[b]Note:[/b] This function is not recursive, which means that nested objects will not be represented as dictionaries. Also, properties passed by reference ([Object], [Dictionary], [Array], and packed arrays) are copied by reference, not duplicated.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_instance_of">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="value" type="Variant" />
			<param index="1" name="type" type="Variant" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if [param value] is an instance of [param type]. The [param type] value must be one of the following:
				- A constant from the [enum Variant.Type] enumeration, for example [constant TYPE_INT].
				- An [Object]-derived class which exists in [ClassDB], for example [Node].
				- A [Script] (you can use any class, including inner one).
				Unlike the right operand of the [code]is[/code] operator, [param type] can be a non-constant value. The [code]is[/code] operator supports more features (such as typed arrays). Use the operator instead of this method if you do not need to check the type dynamically.
				[b]Examples:[/b]
				[codeblock]
				print(is_instance_of(a, TYPE_INT))
				print(is_instance_of(a, Node))
				print(is_instance_of(a, MyClass))
				print(is_instance_of(a, MyClass.InnerClass))
				[/codeblock]
				[b]Note:[/b] If [param value] and/or [param type] are freed objects (see [method @GlobalScope.is_instance_valid]), or [param type] is not one of the above options, this method will raise a runtime error.
				See also [method @GlobalScope.typeof], [method type_exists], [method Array.is_same_typed] (and other [Array] methods).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="len">
			<return type="int" />
			<param index="0" name="var" type="Variant" />
			<description>
				Returns the length of the given Variant [param var]. The length can be the character count of a [String] or [StringName], the element count of any array type, or the size of a [Dictionary]. For every other Variant type, a run-time error is generated and execution is stopped.
				[codeblock]
				var a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
				len(a) # Returns 4

				var b = "Hello!"
				len(b) # Returns 6
				[/codeblock]
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="load">
			<return type="Resource" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns a [Resource] from the filesystem located at the absolute [param path]. Unless it's already referenced elsewhere (such as in another script or in the scene), the resource is loaded from disk on function call, which might cause a slight delay, especially when loading large scenes. To avoid unnecessary delays when loading something multiple times, either store the resource in a variable or use [method preload]. This method is equivalent of using [method ResourceLoader.load] with [constant ResourceLoader.CACHE_MODE_REUSE].
				[b]Note:[/b] Resource paths can be obtained by right-clicking on a resource in the FileSystem dock and choosing "Copy Path", or by dragging the file from the FileSystem dock into the current script.
				[codeblock]
				# Load a scene called "main" located in the root of the project directory and cache it in a variable.
				var main = load("res://main.tscn") # main will contain a PackedScene resource.
				[/codeblock]
				[b]Important:[/b] Relative paths are [i]not[/i] relative to the script calling this method, instead it is prefixed with [code]"res://"[/code]. Loading from relative paths might not work as expected.
				This function is a simplified version of [method ResourceLoader.load], which can be used for more advanced scenarios.
				[b]Note:[/b] Files have to be imported into the engine first to load them using this function. If you want to load [Image]s at run-time, you may use [method Image.load]. If you want to import audio files, you can use the snippet described in [member AudioStreamMP3.data].
				[b]Note:[/b] If [member ProjectSettings.editor/export/convert_text_resources_to_binary] is [code]true[/code], [method @GDScript.load] will not be able to read converted files in an exported project. If you rely on run-time loading of files present within the PCK, set [member ProjectSettings.editor/export/convert_text_resources_to_binary] to [code]false[/code].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="ord">
			<return type="int" />
			<param index="0" name="char" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns an integer representing the Unicode code point of the given character [param char], which should be a string of length 1.
				[codeblock]
				print(ord("A")) # Prints 65
				print(ord("🤖")) # Prints 129302
				[/codeblock]
				This is the inverse of [method char]. See also [method String.chr] and [method String.unicode_at].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="preload">
			<return type="Resource" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns a [Resource] from the filesystem located at [param path]. During run-time, the resource is loaded when the script is being parsed. This function effectively acts as a reference to that resource. Note that this function requires [param path] to be a constant [String]. If you want to load a resource from a dynamic/variable path, use [method load].
				[b]Note:[/b] Resource paths can be obtained by right-clicking on a resource in the Assets Panel and choosing "Copy Path", or by dragging the file from the FileSystem dock into the current script.
				[codeblock]
				# Create instance of a scene.
				var diamond = preload("res://diamond.tscn").instantiate()
				[/codeblock]
				[b]Note:[/b] [method preload] is a keyword, not a function. So you cannot access it as a [Callable].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="print_debug" qualifiers="vararg">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Like [method @GlobalScope.print], but includes the current stack frame when running with the debugger turned on.
				The output in the console may look like the following:
				[codeblock lang=text]
				Test print
				At: res://test.gd:15:_process()
				[/codeblock]
				See also [method print_stack], [method get_stack], and [method Engine.capture_script_backtraces].
				[b]Note:[/b] By default, backtraces are only available in editor builds and debug builds. To enable them for release builds as well, you need to enable [member ProjectSettings.debug/settings/gdscript/always_track_call_stacks].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="print_stack">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Prints a stack trace at the current code location.
				The output in the console may look like the following:
				[codeblock lang=text]
				Frame 0 - res://test.gd:16 in function '_process'
				[/codeblock]
				See also [method print_debug], [method get_stack], and [method Engine.capture_script_backtraces].
				[b]Note:[/b] By default, backtraces are only available in editor builds and debug builds. To enable them for release builds as well, you need to enable [member ProjectSettings.debug/settings/gdscript/always_track_call_stacks].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="range" qualifiers="vararg" keywords="seq">
			<return type="Array" />
			<description>
				Returns an array with the given range. [method range] can be called in three ways:
				[code]range(n: int)[/code]: Starts from 0, increases by steps of 1, and stops [i]before[/i] [code]n[/code]. The argument [code]n[/code] is [b]exclusive[/b].
				[code]range(b: int, n: int)[/code]: Starts from [code]b[/code], increases by steps of 1, and stops [i]before[/i] [code]n[/code]. The arguments [code]b[/code] and [code]n[/code] are [b]inclusive[/b] and [b]exclusive[/b], respectively.
				[code]range(b: int, n: int, s: int)[/code]: Starts from [code]b[/code], increases/decreases by steps of [code]s[/code], and stops [i]before[/i] [code]n[/code]. The arguments [code]b[/code] and [code]n[/code] are [b]inclusive[/b] and [b]exclusive[/b], respectively. The argument [code]s[/code] [b]can[/b] be negative, but not [code]0[/code]. If [code]s[/code] is [code]0[/code], an error message is printed.
				[method range] converts all arguments to [int] before processing.
				[b]Note:[/b] Returns an empty array if no value meets the value constraint (e.g. [code]range(2, 5, -1)[/code] or [code]range(5, 5, 1)[/code]).
				[b]Examples:[/b]
				[codeblock]
				print(range(4))        # Prints [0, 1, 2, 3]
				print(range(2, 5))     # Prints [2, 3, 4]
				print(range(0, 6, 2))  # Prints [0, 2, 4]
				print(range(4, 1, -1)) # Prints [4, 3, 2]
				[/codeblock]
				To iterate over an [Array] backwards, use:
				[codeblock]
				var array = [3, 6, 9]
				for i in range(array.size() - 1, -1, -1):
					print(array[i])
				[/codeblock]
				Output:
				[codeblock lang=text]
				9
				6
				3
				[/codeblock]
				To iterate over [float], convert them in the loop.
				[codeblock]
				for i in range (3, 0, -1):
					print(i / 10.0)
				[/codeblock]
				Output:
				[codeblock lang=text]
				0.3
				0.2
				0.1
				[/codeblock]
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="type_exists">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="type" type="StringName" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the given [Object]-derived class exists in [ClassDB]. Note that [Variant] data types are not registered in [ClassDB].
				[codeblock]
				type_exists("Sprite2D") # Returns true
				type_exists("NonExistentClass") # Returns false

	<constants>
		<constant name="PI" value="3.14159265358979">
			Constant that represents how many times the diameter of a circle fits around its perimeter. This is equivalent to [code]TAU / 2[/code], or 180 degrees in rotations.
		</constant>
		<constant name="TAU" value="6.28318530717959">
			The circle constant, the circumference of the unit circle in radians. This is equivalent to [code]PI * 2[/code], or 360 degrees in rotations.
		</constant>
		<constant name="INF" value="inf">
			Positive floating-point infinity. This is the result of floating-point division when the divisor is [code]0.0[/code]. For negative infinity, use [code]-INF[/code]. Dividing by [code]-0.0[/code] will result in negative infinity if the numerator is positive, so dividing by [code]0.0[/code] is not the same as dividing by [code]-0.0[/code] (despite [code]0.0 == -0.0[/code] returning [code]true[/code]).
			[b]Warning:[/b] Numeric infinity is only a concept with floating-point numbers, and has no equivalent for integers. Dividing an integer number by [code]0[/code] will not result in [constant INF] and will result in a run-time error instead.
		</constant>
		<constant name="NAN" value="nan">
			"Not a Number", an invalid floating-point value. It is returned by some invalid operations, such as dividing floating-point [code]0.0[/code] by [code]0.0[/code].
			[constant NAN] has special properties, including that [code]!=[/code] always returns [code]true[/code], while other comparison operators always return [code]false[/code]. This is true even when comparing with itself ([code]NAN == NAN[/code] returns [code]false[/code] and [code]NAN != NAN[/code] returns [code]true[/code]). Due to this, you must use [method @GlobalScope.is_nan] to check whether a number is equal to [constant NAN].
			[b]Warning:[/b] "Not a Number" is only a concept with floating-point numbers, and has no equivalent for integers. Dividing an integer [code]0[/code] by [code]0[/code] will not result in [constant NAN] and will result in a run-time error instead.

	<annotations>
		<annotation name="@abstract">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Marks a class or a method as abstract.
				An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it is meant to be inherited by other classes. Attempting to instantiate an abstract class will result in an error.
				An abstract method is a method that has no implementation. Therefore, a newline or a semicolon is expected after the function header. This defines a contract that inheriting classes must conform to, because the method signature must be compatible when overriding.
				Inheriting classes must either provide implementations for all abstract methods, or the inheriting class must be marked as abstract. If a class has at least one abstract method (either its own or an unimplemented inherited one), then it must also be marked as abstract. However, the reverse is not true: an abstract class is allowed to have no abstract methods.
				[codeblock]
				@abstract class Shape:
					@abstract func draw()

				class Circle extends Shape:
					func draw():
						print("Drawing a circle.")

				class Square extends Shape:
					func draw():
						print("Drawing a square.")

				Mark the following property as exported (editable in the Inspector dock and saved to disk). To control the type of the exported property, use the type hint notation.
				[codeblock]

				@export var direction_array: Array[Direction]
				@export var image_array: Array[Image]
				@export var node_array: Array[Node]
				[/codeblock]
				[b]Note:[/b] Custom resources and nodes should be registered as global classes using [code]class_name[/code], since the Inspector currently only supports global classes. Otherwise, a less specific type will be exported instead.
				[b]Note:[/b] Node export is only supported in [Node]-derived classes and has a number of other limitations.

The range must be defined by [param min] and [param max], as well as an optional [param step] and a variety of extra hints. The [param step] defaults to [code]1[/code] for integer properties. For floating-point numbers this value depends on your [member EditorSettings.interface/inspector/default_float_step] setting.

				[/codeblock]
				[b]Note:[/b] The property is exported without the [constant PROPERTY_USAGE_STORAGE] flag because a [Callable] cannot be properly serialized and stored in a file.
				[b]Note:[/b] In an exported project neither [EditorInterface] nor [EditorUndoRedoManager] exist, which may cause some scripts to break. To prevent this, you can use [method Engine.get_singleton] and omit the static type from the variable declaration:

				Mark the following method for remote procedure calls. See [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html]High-level multiplayer[/url].
				If [param mode] is set as [code]"any_peer"[/code], allows any peer to call this RPC function. Otherwise, only the authority peer is allowed to call it and [param mode] should be kept as [code]"authority"[/code]. When configuring functions as RPCs with [method Node.rpc_config], each of these modes respectively corresponds to the [constant MultiplayerAPI.RPC_MODE_AUTHORITY] and [constant MultiplayerAPI.RPC_MODE_ANY_PEER] RPC modes. See [enum MultiplayerAPI.RPCMode]. If a peer that is not the authority tries to call a function that is only allowed for the authority, the function will not be executed. If the error can be detected locally (when the RPC configuration is consistent between the local and the remote peer), an error message will be displayed on the sender peer. Otherwise, the remote peer will detect the error and print an error there.
				If [param sync] is set as [code]"call_remote"[/code], the function can only be executed on the remote peer, but not locally. To allow running this function locally too, set [param sync] to [code]"call_local"[/code]. When configuring functions as RPCs with [method Node.rpc_config], this is equivalent to setting [code]call_local[/code] to [code]true[/code].
				The [param transfer_mode] accepted values are [code]"unreliable"[/code], [code]"unreliable_ordered"[/code], or [code]"reliable"[/code]. It sets the transfer mode of the underlying [MultiplayerPeer]. See [member MultiplayerPeer.transfer_mode].
				The [param transfer_channel] defines the channel of the underlying [MultiplayerPeer]. See [member MultiplayerPeer.transfer_channel].
				The order of [param mode], [param sync] and [param transfer_mode] does not matter, but values related to the same argument must not be used more than once. [param transfer_channel] always has to be the 4th argument (you must specify 3 preceding arguments).
