	<description>
		See [GDScript] or [@GDScript] instead.
		Script resource to store traits for GDScript created with the [code].gdt[/code] file extension, allows defining and requiring common methods across multiple classes, along with anything that you would see inside of a GDScript class (signals, classes, etc.).
		[b]Note:[/b] Unlike [GDScript], this resource cannot create instances (see [method GDScript.new]) due to its abstract nature.
