	<brief_description>
		A 3D texture filled with noise generated by a [Noise] object.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Uses the [FastNoiseLite] library or other noise generators to fill the texture data of your desired size.
		The class uses [Thread]s to generate the texture data internally, so [method Texture3D.get_data] may return [code]null[/code] if the generation process has not completed yet. In that case, you need to wait for the texture to be generated before accessing the image:
		[codeblock]
		var texture = NoiseTexture3D.new()
		texture.noise = FastNoiseLite.new()
		await texture.changed
		var data = texture.get_data()
		[/codeblock]

	<members>
		<member name="color_ramp" type="Gradient" setter="set_color_ramp" getter="get_color_ramp">
			A [Gradient] which is used to map the luminance of each pixel to a color value.
		</member>
		<member name="depth" type="int" setter="set_depth" getter="get_depth" default="64">
			Depth of the generated texture (in pixels).
		</member>
		<member name="height" type="int" setter="set_height" getter="get_height" default="64">
			Height of the generated texture (in pixels).
		</member>
		<member name="invert" type="bool" setter="set_invert" getter="get_invert" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], inverts the noise texture. White becomes black, black becomes white.
		</member>
		<member name="noise" type="Noise" setter="set_noise" getter="get_noise">
			The instance of the [Noise] object.
		</member>
		<member name="normalize" type="bool" setter="set_normalize" getter="is_normalized" default="true">
			If [code]true[/code], the noise image coming from the noise generator is normalized to the range [code]0.0[/code] to [code]1.0[/code].
			Turning normalization off can affect the contrast and allows you to generate non repeating tileable noise textures.
		</member>
		<member name="seamless" type="bool" setter="set_seamless" getter="get_seamless" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], a seamless texture is requested from the [Noise] resource.
			[b]Note:[/b] Seamless noise textures may take longer to generate and/or can have a lower contrast compared to non-seamless noise depending on the used [Noise] resource. This is because some implementations use higher dimensions for generating seamless noise.
			[b]Note:[/b] The default [FastNoiseLite] implementation uses the fallback path for seamless generation. If using a [member width], [member height] or [member depth] lower than the default, you may need to increase [member seamless_blend_skirt] to make seamless blending more effective.
		</member>
		<member name="seamless_blend_skirt" type="float" setter="set_seamless_blend_skirt" getter="get_seamless_blend_skirt" default="0.1">
			Used for the default/fallback implementation of the seamless texture generation. It determines the distance over which the seams are blended. High values may result in less details and contrast. See [Noise] for further details.
			[b]Note:[/b] If using a [member width], [member height] or [member depth] lower than the default, you may need to increase [member seamless_blend_skirt] to make seamless blending more effective.
		</member>
		<member name="width" type="int" setter="set_width" getter="get_width" default="64">
			Width of the generated texture (in pixels).
