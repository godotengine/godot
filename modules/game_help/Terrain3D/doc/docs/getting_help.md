Getting Help
===================

**Video Tutorials**: Make sure to watch the [tutorial videos](tutorial_videos.md) which show proper installation, setup, and how to use most of the tools.

**Read the docs**: Many questions have already been addressed in this documentation, especially in [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) and [Setting Up Textures](texture_prep.md).

**Discord**: For questions or technical issues, join the [Tokisan discord server](https://tokisan.com/discord) and ask in the `#terrain-help` channel.

**Issues**: For technical issues or bug reports, search through the [issues](https://github.com/TokisanGames/Terrain3D/issues) to ensure it hasn't already been reported, then create a new one. Use discord for questions.

## Help Us Help You

Terrain3D has been stable for hundreds of users for many months, so we know it works fine when setup properly. If you're having trouble, there's a 90% chance it's not setup properly. We can help you get setup, but only if you provide adequate information.

At a minimum we need the following:

* A concise description of the problem, what you expect to happen, and what is happening.
* The exact version of Godot and of Terrain3D you're using.
    * Or, click your Terrain3D node and provide a full screenshot, which will include that and other information.
* Your Operating system and GPU.
* Confirmation of, or a screenshot of your Project Settings / Plugins screen to show that Terrain3D is enabled, and what other plugins you have.
* A screenshot or copy of all text in your [console](troubleshooting.md#use-the-console), beginning with the initial Godot Engine startup message.

If you have trouble with textures, we also need:
* Double click a texture file and show the file format and size as reported by the Godot inspector. Select either the first texture, or a relevant problem texture.
* A shot of your import tab with that same texture selected.

Finally, be ready to provide [debugging logs](troubleshooting.md#debug-logs), and what steps you tried, and the results of those steps.
