		FBX 3D asset importer.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This is an FBX 3D asset importer with full support for most FBX features.
		If exporting a FBX scene from Autodesk Maya, use these FBX export settings:
		[codeblock]
		- Smoothing Groups
		- Smooth Mesh
		- Triangluate (for meshes with blend shapes)
		- Bake Animation
		- Resample All
		- Deformed Models
		- Skins
		- Blend Shapes
		- Curve Filters
		- Constant Key Reducer
		- Auto Tangents Only
		- *Do not check* Constraints (as it will break the file)
		- Can check Embed Media (embeds textures into the exported FBX file)
		  - Note that when importing embedded media, the texture and mesh will be a single immutable file.
		  - You will have to re-export then re-import the FBX if the texture has changed.
		- Units: Centimeters
		- Up Axis: Y
		- Binary format in FBX 2017
