		Represents a glTF accessor.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		GLTFAccessor is a data structure representing a glTF [code]accessor[/code] that would be found in the [code]"accessors"[/code] array. A buffer is a blob of binary data. A buffer view is a slice of a buffer. An accessor is a typed interpretation of the data in a buffer view.
		Most custom data stored in glTF does not need accessors, only buffer views (see [GLTFBufferView]). Accessors are for more advanced use cases such as interleaved mesh data encoded for the GPU.
