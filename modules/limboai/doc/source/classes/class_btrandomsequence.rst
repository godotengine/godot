BT composite that executes tasks in random order as long as they return ``SUCCESS``.

Description
-----------

BTRandomSequence executes its child tasks in a random order as long as they return ``SUCCESS``. If a child task results in ``SUCCESS``, BTRandomSequence will immediately execute the next child task until one of them returns ``FAILURE`` or all of them result in ``SUCCESS``.

Returns ``RUNNING`` if a child task results in ``RUNNING``. BTRandomSequence will remember the execution order and the last child task that returned ``RUNNING``, ensuring it resumes from that point in the next tick.

Returns ``FAILURE`` if a child task results in ``FAILURE``.

Returns ``SUCCESS`` if all child tasks result in ``SUCCESS``.
