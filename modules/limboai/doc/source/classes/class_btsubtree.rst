BTSubtree
=========

**Inherits:** :ref:`BTNewScope<class_BTNewScope>` **<** :ref:`BTDecorator<class_BTDecorator>` **<** :ref:`BTTask<class_BTTask>` **<** :ref:`BT<class_BT>`

BT decorator that instantiates and runs a subtree within the larger tree.

.. rst-class:: classref-introduction-group

Description
-----------

BTSubtree instantiates a :ref:`BehaviorTree<class_BehaviorTree>` and includes its root task as a child during initialization, while also creating a new :ref:`Blackboard<class_Blackboard>` scope.

Returns the status of the subtree's execution.

Note: BTSubTree is designed as a simpler loader, and does not support updating :ref:`subtree<class_BTSubtree_property_subtree>` at runtime. A custom subtree decorator is better suited and `somewhat trivial <https://github.com/limbonaut/limboai/issues/94#issuecomment-2068833610>`__ to implement.
