BT composite that sequentially executes tasks as long as they return ``SUCCESS``.

Description
-----------

BTSequence executes its child tasks sequentially, from first to last, as long as they return ``SUCCESS``. If a child task results in ``SUCCESS``, BTSequence will immediately execute the next child task until one of them returns ``FAILURE`` or all of them result in ``SUCCESS``. BTSequence and :ref:`BTSelector<class_BTSelector>` are two of the most common building blocks of behavior trees. Essentially, while :ref:`BTSelector<class_BTSelector>` is similar to a boolean OR operation, BTSequence is similar to a boolean AND operation. Sequences enable the behavior tree to compose complex behaviors from a chain of simpler tasks.

Returns ``RUNNING`` if any child task results in ``RUNNING``. BTSequence will remember the last child task that returned ``RUNNING``, ensuring it resumes from that point in the next execution tick.

Returns ``SUCCESS`` if all child tasks result in ``SUCCESS``.

Returns ``FAILURE`` if a child task results in ``FAILURE``.
