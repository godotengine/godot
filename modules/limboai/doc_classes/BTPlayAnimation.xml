	</brief_description>
	<description>
		BTPlayAnimation action plays an animation on the specified [AnimationPlayer] node. If the [member await_completion] is greater than [code]0[/code], the action will wait for the animation to complete, with the maximum waiting time equal to [member await_completion].
		Returns [code]SUCCESS[/code] if the animation finishes playing or if the elapsed time exceeds [member await_completion]. When [member await_completion] is set to [code]0[/code], BTPlayAnimation doesn't wait for the animation to finish and immediately returns [code]SUCCESS[/code].
		Returns [code]RUNNING[/code] if the animation is still playing and the elapsed time is less than [member await_completion].
		Returns [code]FAILURE[/code] if the action fails to play the requested animation.
