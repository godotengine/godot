			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="channel" type="int" />
			<param index="1" name="packet" type="PackedByteArray" />
			<param index="2" name="flags" type="int" />

		<method name="channel_limit">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="limit" type="int" />
			<description>

			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="compress">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="mode" type="int" enum="ENetConnection.CompressionMode" />
			<description>
				Sets the compression method used for network packets. These have different tradeoffs of compression speed versus bandwidth, you may need to test which one works best for your use case if you use compression at all.
				[b]Note:[/b] Most games' network design involve sending many small packets frequently (smaller than 4 KB each). If in doubt, it is recommended to keep the default compression algorithm as it works best on these small packets.
				[b]Note:[/b] The compression mode must be set to the same value on both the server and all its clients. Clients will fail to connect if the compression mode set on the client differs from the one set on the server.

		<method name="service">
			<return type="Array" />
			<param index="0" name="timeout" type="int" default="0" />
			<description>
				Waits for events on the host specified and shuttles packets between the host and its peers. The returned [Array] will have 4 elements. An [enum EventType], the [ENetPacketPeer] which generated the event, the event associated data (if any), the event associated channel (if any). If the generated event is [constant EVENT_RECEIVE], the received packet will be queued to the associated [ENetPacketPeer].
				Call this function regularly to handle connections, disconnections, and to receive new packets.

			<param index="0" name="destination_address" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="destination_port" type="int" />
			<param index="2" name="packet" type="PackedByteArray" />
			<description>
				Sends a [param packet] toward a destination from the address and port currently bound by this ENetConnection instance.
				This is useful as it serves to establish entries in NAT routing tables on all devices between this bound instance and the public facing internet, allowing a prospective client's connection packets to be routed backward through the NAT device(s) between the public internet and this host.
				This requires forward knowledge of a prospective client's address and communication port as seen by the public internet - after any NAT devices have handled their connection request. This information can be obtained by a [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN]STUN[/url] service, and must be handed off to your host by an entity that is not the prospective client. This will never work for a client behind a Symmetric NAT due to the nature of the Symmetric NAT routing algorithm, as their IP and Port cannot be known beforehand.

	<constants>
		<constant name="COMPRESS_NONE" value="0" enum="CompressionMode">

			ENet's built-in range encoding. Works well on small packets, but is not the most efficient algorithm on packets larger than 4 KB.
		</constant>
		<constant name="COMPRESS_FASTLZ" value="2" enum="CompressionMode">
