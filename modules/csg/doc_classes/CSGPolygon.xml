		Extrudes a 2D polygon shape to create a 3D mesh.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		An array of 2D points is extruded to quickly and easily create a variety of 3D meshes. See also [CSGMesh] for using 3D meshes as CSG nodes.
		[b]Note:[/b] CSG nodes are intended to be used for level prototyping. Creating CSG nodes has a significant CPU cost compared to creating a [MeshInstance] with a [PrimitiveMesh]. Moving a CSG node within another CSG node also has a significant CPU cost, so it should be avoided during gameplay.

		<member name="depth" type="float" setter="set_depth" getter="get_depth" default="1.0">
			When [member mode] is [constant MODE_DEPTH], the depth of the extrusion.
		</member>
		<member name="material" type="Material" setter="set_material" getter="get_material">
			Material to use for the resulting mesh. The UV maps the top half of the material to the extruded shape (U along the the length of the extrusions and V around the outline of the [member polygon]), the bottom-left quarter to the front end face, and the bottom-right quarter to the back end face.
		</member>
		<member name="mode" type="int" setter="set_mode" getter="get_mode" enum="CSGPolygon.Mode" default="0">
			The [member mode] used to extrude the [member polygon].
		</member>
		<member name="path_continuous_u" type="bool" setter="set_path_continuous_u" getter="is_path_continuous_u">
			When [member mode] is [constant MODE_PATH], by default, the top half of the [member material] is stretched along the entire length of the extruded shape. If [code]false[/code] the top half of the material is repeated every step of the extrusion.
		</member>
		<member name="path_interval" type="float" setter="set_path_interval" getter="get_path_interval">
			When [member mode] is [constant MODE_PATH], the path interval or ratio of path points to extrusions.
		</member>
		<member name="path_interval_type" type="int" setter="set_path_interval_type" getter="get_path_interval_type" enum="CSGPolygon.PathIntervalType">
			When [member mode] is [constant MODE_PATH], this will determine if the interval should be by distance ([constant PATH_INTERVAL_DISTANCE]) or subdivision fractions ([constant PATH_INTERVAL_SUBDIVIDE]).
		</member>
		<member name="path_joined" type="bool" setter="set_path_joined" getter="is_path_joined">
			When [member mode] is [constant MODE_PATH], if [code]true[/code] the ends of the path are joined, by adding an extrusion between the last and first points of the path.
		</member>
		<member name="path_local" type="bool" setter="set_path_local" getter="is_path_local">
			When [member mode] is [constant MODE_PATH], if [code]true[/code] the [Transform] of the [CSGPolygon] is used as the starting point for the extrusions, not the [Transform] of the [member path_node].
		</member>
		<member name="path_node" type="NodePath" setter="set_path_node" getter="get_path_node">
			When [member mode] is [constant MODE_PATH], the location of the [Path] object used to extrude the [member polygon].
		</member>
		<member name="path_rotation" type="int" setter="set_path_rotation" getter="get_path_rotation" enum="CSGPolygon.PathRotation">
			When [member mode] is [constant MODE_PATH], the [enum PathRotation] method used to rotate the [member polygon] as it is extruded.
		</member>
		<member name="path_simplify_angle" type="float" setter="set_path_simplify_angle" getter="get_path_simplify_angle">
			When [member mode] is [constant MODE_PATH], extrusions that are less than this angle, will be merged together to reduce polygon count.
		</member>
		<member name="path_u_distance" type="float" setter="set_path_u_distance" getter="get_path_u_distance">
			When [member mode] is [constant MODE_PATH], this is the distance along the path, in meters, the texture coordinates will tile. When set to 0, texture coordinates will match geometry exactly with no tiling.
		</member>
		<member name="polygon" type="PoolVector2Array" setter="set_polygon" getter="get_polygon" default="PoolVector2Array( 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0 )">
			The point array that defines the 2D polygon that is extruded. This can be a convex or concave polygon with 3 or more points. The polygon must [i]not[/i] have any intersecting edges. Otherwise, triangulation will fail and no mesh will be generated.
			[b]Note:[/b] If only 1 or 2 points are defined in [member polygon], no mesh will be generated.
		</member>
		<member name="smooth_faces" type="bool" setter="set_smooth_faces" getter="get_smooth_faces" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], applies smooth shading to the extrusions.

			When [member mode] is [constant MODE_SPIN], the total number of degrees the [member polygon] is rotated when extruding.
