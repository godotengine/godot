		A CSG convex hull shape.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This CSG node is a mesh that wraps the convex hull of a set of points. Every point in [member points] is inside or on the surface of the mesh.
		[b]Note:[/b] CSG nodes are intended to be used for level prototyping. Creating CSG nodes has a significant CPU cost compared to creating a [MeshInstance3D] with a [PrimitiveMesh]. Moving a CSG node within another CSG node also has a significant CPU cost, so it should be avoided during gameplay.

			[b]Note:[/b] If fewer than four points are defined or all points are coplanar, no mesh is generated.

			If [code]true[/code], the normals of the convex hull are set to give a smooth effect, making the shape seem rounded or organic. If [code]false[/code], the shape will have a flat shaded, sharp look.
