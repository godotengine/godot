		<method name="close">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Closes this data channel, notifying the other peer.

		<method name="get_buffered_amount" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns the number of bytes currently queued to be sent over this channel.
			</description>

		<method name="get_max_packet_life_time" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns the [code]maxPacketLifeTime[/code] value assigned to this channel during creation.
				Will be [code]65535[/code] if not specified.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_max_retransmits" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns the [code]maxRetransmits[/code] value assigned to this channel during creation.

			<description>
				Returns the current state of this channel.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_negotiated" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>

			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_ordered" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if this channel was created with ordering enabled (default).

		</method>
		<method name="was_string_packet" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the last received packet was transferred as text. See [member write_mode].
			</description>

	<constants>
		<constant name="WRITE_MODE_TEXT" value="0" enum="WriteMode">
			Tells the channel to send data over this channel as text. An external peer (non-Godot) would receive this as a string.

		<constant name="WRITE_MODE_BINARY" value="1" enum="WriteMode">
			Tells the channel to send data over this channel as binary. An external peer (non-Godot) would receive this as array buffer or blob.

			The channel was created, but it's still trying to connect.
		</constant>
		<constant name="STATE_OPEN" value="1" enum="ChannelState">
			The channel is currently open, and data can flow over it.
		</constant>
		<constant name="STATE_CLOSING" value="2" enum="ChannelState">
			The channel is being closed, no new messages will be accepted, but those already in queue will be flushed.
