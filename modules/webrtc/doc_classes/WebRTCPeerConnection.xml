		Interface to a WebRTC peer connection.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A WebRTC connection between the local computer and a remote peer. Provides an interface to connect, maintain and monitor the connection.
		Setting up a WebRTC connection between two peers from now on) may not seem a trivial task, but it can be broken down into 3 main steps:
		- The peer that wants to initiate the connection ([code]A[/code] from now on) creates an offer and send it to the other peer ([code]B[/code] from now on).
		- [code]B[/code] receives the offer, generate and answer, and sends it to [code]A[/code]).
		- [code]A[/code] and [code]B[/code] then generates and exchange ICE candidates with each other.
		After these steps, the connection should become connected. Keep on reading or look into the tutorial for more information.

			<description>
				Close the peer connection and all data channels associated with it. Note, you cannot reuse this object for a new connection unless you call [method initialize].

			</argument>
			<description>
				Returns a new [WebRTCDataChannel] (or [code]null[/code] on failure) with given [code]label[/code] and optionally configured via the [code]options[/code] dictionary. This method can only be called when the connection is in state [constant STATE_NEW].
				There are two ways to create a working data channel: either call [method create_data_channel] on only one of the peer and listen to [signal data_channel_received] on the other, or call [method create_data_channel] on both peers, with the same values, and the [code]negotiated[/code] option set to [code]true[/code].
				Valid [code]options[/code] are:
				[codeblock]
				{
				    "negotiated": true, # When set to true (default off), means the channel is negotiated out of band. "id" must be set too. data_channel_received will not be called.
				    "id": 1, # When "negotiated" is true this value must also be set to the same value on both peer.

				    # Only one of maxRetransmits and maxPacketLifeTime can be specified, not both. They make the channel unreliable (but also better at real time).
				    "maxRetransmits": 1, # Specify the maximum number of attempt the peer will make to retransmits packets if they are not acknowledged.
				    "maxPacketLifeTime": 100, # Specify the maximum amount of time before giving up retransmitions of unacknowledged packets (in milliseconds).
				    "ordered": true, # When in unreliable mode (i.e. either "maxRetransmits" or "maxPacketLifetime" is set), "ordered" (true by default) specify if packet ordering is to be enforced.

				    "protocol": "my-custom-protocol", # A custom sub-protocol string for this channel.
				}
				[/codeblock]
				[b]Note:[/b] You must keep a reference to channels created this way, or it will be closed.

		<method name="create_offer">
			<return type="int" enum="Error">

			<description>
				Creates a new SDP offer to start a WebRTC connection with a remote peer. At least one [WebRTCDataChannel] must have been created before calling this method.
				If this functions returns [constant OK], [signal session_description_created] will be called when the session is ready to be sent.

			<description>
				Re-initialize this peer connection, closing any previously active connection, and going back to state [constant STATE_NEW]. A dictionary of [code]options[/code] can be passed to configure the peer connection.
				Valid [code]options[/code] are:
				[codeblock]
				{
				    "iceServers": [
				        {
				            "urls": [ "stun:stun.example.com:3478" ], # One or more STUN servers.

				            "urls": [ "turn:turn.example.com:3478" ], # One or more TURN servers.
				            "username": "a_username", # Optional username for the TURN server.

			<description>
				Sets the SDP description of the local peer. This should be called in response to [signal session_description_created].
				After calling this function the peer will start emitting [signal ice_candidate_created] (unless an [enum Error] different from [constant OK] is returned).

			<description>
				Sets the SDP description of the remote peer. This should be called with the values generated by a remote peer and received over the signaling server.
				If [code]type[/code] is [code]offer[/code] the peer will emit [signal session_description_created] with the appropriate answer.
				If [code]type[/code] is [code]answer[/code] the peer will start emitting [signal ice_candidate_created].

				Emitted when a new in-band channel is received, i.e. when the channel was created with [code]negotiated: false[/code] (default).
				The object will be an instance of [WebRTCDataChannel]. You must keep a reference of it or it will be closed automatically. See [method create_data_channel].
