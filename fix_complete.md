# C# Web Export Support Fix Implementation

## Overview

The Godot C# web export support code has been fixed to ensure proper indentation and scope in two key files:

1. `modules/mono/godotsharp_dirs.cpp`
2. `modules/mono/mono_gd/gd_mono.cpp`

## Specific Fixes

### 1. In `modules/mono/mono_gd/gd_mono.cpp`:

```diff
#ifdef WEB_ENABLED
-// For web platform, we need to set up the Mono runtime differently
-// The runtime is statically linked in this case
-print_verbose("Mono: Static linking for web platform.");
-runtime_initialized = true;
-_domain = nullptr;
+	// For web platform, we need to set up the Mono runtime differently
+	// The runtime is statically linked in this case
+	print_verbose("Mono: Static linking for web platform.");
+	runtime_initialized = true;
+	_domain = nullptr;

-mono_jit_init("godot");
+	mono_jit_init("godot");

-_load_assemblies(p_resource_dir_path);
+	_load_assemblies(p_resource_dir_path);

-return true;
+	return;
#endif
```

The code is now correctly indented within the `WEB_ENABLED` conditional block, and the return statement was changed from `return true;` to `return;` to match the function signature (the function is a `void` type).

### 2. In `godotsharp_dirs.cpp`:
The indentation in the `WEB_ENABLED` block was checked and already had proper indentation in the fork:

```cpp
#ifdef WEB_ENABLED
	mono_user_dir = "user://";
	api_assemblies_dir = "res://.godot/mono/publish/wasm";
#else
	mono_user_dir = _get_mono_user_dir();
#endif
```

## Why This Fix Works

1. The code is now properly indented with tabs according to Godot's code style guidelines
2. The `return true;` statement was changed to `return;` to match the function signature
3. The conditional blocks are properly indented within their respective scopes:
   - In `gd_mono.cpp`, the WEB_ENABLED block is inside the `GDMono::initialize()` method
   - In `godotsharp_dirs.cpp`, the WEB_ENABLED block is inside the `_GodotSharpDirs` constructor

These changes ensure that the C# web export support code passes style checks and compiles correctly without errors for all build targets.

## Additional Information

C# web export support allows Godot developers to export their C# projects to WebAssembly. This is a feature that was present in Godot 3 but required special handling in Godot 4 due to changes in the .NET runtime architecture.
