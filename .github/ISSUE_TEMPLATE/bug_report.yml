      - When reporting bugs, you'll make our life simpler (and the fix will come sooner) if you follow the guidelines in this template.
      - Write a descriptive issue title above.
      - The golden rule is to **always open *one* issue for *one* bug**. If you notice several bugs and want to report them, make sure to create one new issue for each of them.
      - Search [open](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues) and [closed](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues to ensure it has not already been reported. If you don't find a relevant match or if you're unsure, don't hesitate to **open a new issue**. The bugsquad will handle it from there if it's a duplicate.
      - Verify that you are using a [supported Godot version](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/about/release_policy.html).

      Specify the Godot version, including the Git commit hash if using a development or non-official build. The exact Godot version (including the commit hash) can be copied by clicking the version shown in the editor (bottom bar) or in the project manager (top bar).
      If you use a custom build, please test if your issue is reproducible in official builds too.

      - Specify the OS version, and when relevant hardware information.
      - For issues that are likely OS-specific and/or graphics-related, please specify the CPU model and architecture.
      - For graphics-related issues, specify the GPU model, driver version, and the rendering backend (GLES2, GLES3, Vulkan).
      - **Bug reports not including the required information may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.** If in doubt, always include all the requested information; it's better to include too much information than not enough information.
      - **Starting from Godot 4.1, you can copy this information to your clipboard by using *Help > Copy System Info* at the top of the editor window.**

      List of steps or sample code that reproduces the issue. Having reproducible issues is a prerequisite for contributors to be able to solve them.
      If you include a minimal reproduction project below, you can detail how to use it here.

    label: Minimal reproduction project
    description: |
      - A small Godot project which reproduces the issue, with no unnecessary files included. Be sure to not include the `.godot` folder in the archive (but keep `project.godot`).
      - Required, unless the reproduction steps are trivial and don't require any project files to be followed. In this case, write "N/A" in the field.
      - Drag and drop a ZIP archive to upload it. **Do not select another field until the project is done uploading.**
      - **Note for C# users:** If your issue is *not* C#-specific, please upload a minimal reproduction project written in GDScript. This will make it easier for contributors to reproduce the issue locally as not everyone has a .NET setup available.
      - **If you've been asked by a maintainer to upload a minimal reproduction project, you *must* do so within 7 days.** Otherwise, your bug report will be closed as it'll be considered too difficult to diagnose.
