 * - drawing shapes: line, arc, curve, path, polygon...
 * - drawing pictures: tvg, svg, png, jpg, bitmap...
 * - drawing fillings: solid, linear and radial gradient...
 * - drawing stroking: continuous stroking with arbitrary width, join, cap, dash styles.
 * - drawing composition: blending, masking, path clipping...
 * - drawing scene graph & affine transformation (translation, rotation, scale, ...)
 * and finally drawing the canvas and TVG termination.
