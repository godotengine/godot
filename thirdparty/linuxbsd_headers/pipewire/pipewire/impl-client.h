/** \page page_client_impl Client Implementation
 *
 * \see \ref pw_impl_client
 *
 * \section sec_page_client_impl_overview Overview
 *
 * The \ref pw_impl_client object is created by a protocol implementation when
 * a new client connects.
 *
 * The client is used to keep track of all resources belonging to one
 * connection with the PipeWire server.
 *
 * \section sec_page_client_impl_credentials Credentials
 *
 * The client object will have its credentials filled in by the protocol.
 * This information is used to check if a resource or action is available
 * for this client.
 *
 * \section sec_page_client_impl_types Types
 *
 * The client and server maintain a mapping between the client and server
 * types. All type ids that are in messages exchanged between the client
 * and server will automatically be remapped.
 *
 * \section sec_page_client_impl_resources Resources
 *
 * When a client binds to context global object, a resource is made for this
 * binding and a unique id is assigned to the resources. The client and
 * server will use this id as the destination when exchanging messages.
 * See also \ref pw_resource

/** \defgroup pw_impl_client Client Impl
 *
 * \brief PipeWire client object class
 *
 * The client object represents a client connection with the PipeWire
 * server.
 *
 * Each client has its own list of resources it is bound to along with
 * a mapping between the client types and server types.
 *
 * \see \ref page_client_impl
