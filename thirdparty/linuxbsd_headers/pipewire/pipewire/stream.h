/** \page page_streams Streams
 *
 * \see \ref pw_stream
 *
 * \section sec_overview Overview
 *
 * \ref pw_stream "Streams" are used to exchange data with the
 * PipeWire server. A stream is a wrapper around a proxy for a pw_client_node
 * with an adapter. This means the stream will automatically do conversion
 * to the type required by the server.
 *
 * Streams can be used to:
 *
 * \li Consume a stream from PipeWire. This is a PW_DIRECTION_INPUT stream.
 * \li Produce a stream to PipeWire. This is a PW_DIRECTION_OUTPUT stream
 *
 * You can connect the stream port to a specific server port or let PipeWire
 * choose a port for you.
 *
 * For more complicated nodes such as filters or ports with multiple
 * inputs and/or outputs you will need to use the pw_filter or make
 * a pw_node yourself and export it with \ref pw_core_export.
 *
 * Streams can also be used to:
 *
 * \li Implement a Sink in PipeWire. This is a PW_DIRECTION_INPUT stream.
 * \li Implement a Source in PipeWire. This is a PW_DIRECTION_OUTPUT stream
 *
 * In this case, the PW_KEY_MEDIA_CLASS property needs to be set to
 * "Audio/Sink" or "Audio/Source" respectively.
 *
 * \section sec_create Create
 *
 * Make a new stream with \ref pw_stream_new(). You will need to specify
 * a name for the stream and extra properties. The basic set of properties
 * each stream must provide is filled in automatically.
 *
 * Once the stream is created, the state_changed event should be used to
 * track the state of the stream.
 *
 * \section sec_connect Connect
 *
 * The stream is initially unconnected. To connect the stream, use
 * \ref pw_stream_connect(). Pass the desired direction as an argument.
 *
 * The direction is:

 * \li PW_DIRECTION_INPUT for a stream that *consumes* data. This can be a
 * stream that captures from a Source or a when the stream is used to
 * implement a Sink. An application will use a \ref PW_DIRECTION_INPUT
 * stream to record data. A virtual sound card will use a
 * \ref PW_DIRECTION_INPUT stream to implement audio playback.
 *
 * \li PW_DIRECTION_OUTPUT for a stream that *produces* data. This can be a
 * stream that plays to a Sink or when the stream is used to implement
 * a Source. An application will use a \ref PW_DIRECTION_OUTPUT
 * stream to produce data. A virtual sound card or camera will use a
 * \ref PW_DIRECTION_OUTPUT stream to implement audio or video recording.
 *
 * \subsection ssec_stream_target Stream target
 *
 * To make the newly connected stream automatically connect to an existing
 * PipeWire node, use the \ref PW_STREAM_FLAG_AUTOCONNECT and set the
 * PW_KEY_OBJECT_SERIAL or the PW_KEY_NODE_NAME value of the target node
 * in the PW_KEY_TARGET_OBJECT property before connecting.
 *
 * \subsection ssec_stream_formats Stream formats
 *
 * An array of possible formats that this stream can consume or provide
 * must be specified.
 *
 * \section sec_format Format negotiation
 *
 * After connecting the stream, the server will want to configure some
 * parameters on the stream. You will be notified of these changes
 * with the param_changed event.
 *
 * When a format param change is emitted, the client should now prepare
 * itself to deal with the format and complete the negotiation procedure
 * with a call to \ref pw_stream_update_params().
 *
 * As arguments to \ref pw_stream_update_params() an array of spa_param
 * structures must be given. They contain parameters such as buffer size,
 * number of buffers, required metadata and other parameters for the
 * media buffers.
 *
 * \section sec_buffers Buffer negotiation
 *
 * After completing the format negotiation, PipeWire will allocate and
 * notify the stream of the buffers that will be used to exchange data
 * between client and server.
 *
 * With the add_buffer event, a stream will be notified of a new buffer
 * that can be used for data transport. You can attach user_data to these
 * buffers. The buffers can only be used with the stream that emitted
 * the add_buffer event.
 *
 * After the buffers are negotiated, the stream will transition to the
 * \ref PW_STREAM_STATE_PAUSED state.
 *
 * \section sec_streaming Streaming
 *
 * From the \ref PW_STREAM_STATE_PAUSED state, the stream can be set to
 * the \ref PW_STREAM_STATE_STREAMING state by the PipeWire server when
 * data transport is started.
 *
 * Depending on how the stream was connected it will need to Produce or
 * Consume data for/from PipeWire as explained in the following
 * subsections.
 *
 * \subsection ssec_consume Consume data
 *
 * The process event is emitted for each new buffer that can be
 * consumed.
 *
 * \ref pw_stream_dequeue_buffer() should be used to get the data and
 * metadata of the buffer.
 *
 * The buffer is owned by the stream and stays alive until the
 * remove_buffer callback has returned or the stream is destroyed.
 *
 * When the buffer has been processed, call \ref pw_stream_queue_buffer()
 * to let PipeWire reuse the buffer.
 *
 * \subsection ssec_produce Produce data
 *
 * \ref pw_stream_dequeue_buffer() gives an empty buffer that can be filled.
 *
 * The buffer is owned by the stream and stays alive until the
 * remove_buffer event is emitted or the stream is destroyed.
 *
 * Filled buffers should be queued with \ref pw_stream_queue_buffer().
 *
 * The process event is emitted when PipeWire has emptied a buffer that
 * can now be refilled.
 *
 * \section sec_stream_driving Driving the graph
 *
 * Starting in 0.3.34, it is possible for a stream to drive the graph.
 * This allows interrupt-driven scheduling for drivers implemented as
 * PipeWire streams, without having to reimplement the stream as a SPA
 * plugin.
 *
 * A stream cannot drive the graph unless it is in the
 * \ref PW_STREAM_STATE_STREAMING state and \ref pw_stream_is_driving() returns
 * true. It must then use pw_stream_trigger_process() to start the graph
 * cycle.
 *
 * \section sec_stream_disconnect Disconnect
 *
 * Use \ref pw_stream_disconnect() to disconnect a stream after use.
 *
 * \section sec_stream_configuration Configuration
 *
 * \subsection ssec_config_properties Stream Properties
 *
 * \subsection ssec_config_rules Stream Rules
 *
 * \section sec_stream_environment Environment Variables
 *
 * The environment variable PIPEWIRE_AUTOCONNECT can be used to override the
 * flag and force apps to autoconnect or not.

/** A time structure.
 *
 * Use pw_stream_get_time_n() to get an updated time snapshot of the stream.
 * The time snapshot can give information about the time in the driver of the
 * graph, the delay to the edge of the graph and the internal queuing in the
 * stream.
 *
 * pw_time.ticks gives a monotonic increasing counter of the time in the graph
 * driver. I can be used to generate a timetime to schedule samples as well
 * as detect discontinuities in the timeline caused by xruns.
 *
 * pw_time.delay is expressed as pw_time.rate, the time domain of the graph. This
 * value, and pw_time.ticks, were captured at pw_time.now and can be extrapolated
 * to the current time like this:
 *
 *\code{.c}
 *    uint64_t now = pw_stream_get_nsec(stream);
 *    int64_t diff = now - pw_time.now;
 *    int64_t elapsed = (pw_time.rate.denom * diff) / (pw_time.rate.num * SPA_NSEC_PER_SEC);
 *\endcode
 *
 * pw_time.delay contains the total delay that a signal will travel through the
 * graph. This includes the delay caused by filters in the graph as well as delays
 * caused by the hardware. The delay is usually quite stable and should only change when
 * the topology, quantum or samplerate of the graph changes.
 *
 * pw_time.queued and pw_time.buffered is expressed in the time domain of the stream,
 * or the format that is used for the buffers of this stream.
 *
 * pw_time.queued is the sum of all the pw_buffer.size fields of the buffers that are
 * currently queued in the stream but not yet processed. The application can choose
 * the units of this value, for example, time, samples, frames or bytes (below
 * expressed as app.rate).
 *
 * pw_time.buffered is format dependent, for audio/raw it contains the number of frames
 * that are buffered inside the resampler/converter.
 *
 * The total delay of data in a stream is the sum of the queued and buffered data
 * (not yet processed data) and the delay to the edge of the graph, usually a
 * playback or capture device.
 *
 * For an audio playback stream, if you were to queue a buffer, the total delay
 * in milliseconds for the first sample in the newly queued buffer to be played
 * by the hardware can be calculated as:
 *
 *\code{.unparsed}
 *  (pw_time.buffered * 1000 / stream.samplerate) +
 *    (pw_time.queued * 1000 / app.rate) +
 *     ((pw_time.delay - elapsed) * 1000 * pw_time.rate.num / pw_time.rate.denom)
 *\endcode
 *
 * The current extrapolated time (in ms) in the source or sink can be calculated as:
 *
 *\code{.unparsed}
 *  (pw_time.ticks + elapsed) * 1000 * pw_time.rate.num / pw_time.rate.denom
 *\endcode
 *
 * Below is an overview of the different timing values:
 *
 *\code{.unparsed}
 *           stream time domain           graph time domain
