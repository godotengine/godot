/*
 * This module implements the well-known Heckbert paradigm for color
 * quantization.  Most of the ideas used here can be traced back to
 * Heckbert's seminal paper
 *   Heckbert, Paul.  "Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display",
 *   Proc. SIGGRAPH '82, Computer Graphics v.16 #3 (July 1982), pp 297-304.
 *
 * In the first pass over the image, we accumulate a histogram showing the
 * usage count of each possible color.  To keep the histogram to a reasonable
 * size, we reduce the precision of the input; typical practice is to retain
 * 5 or 6 bits per color, so that 8 or 4 different input values are counted
 * in the same histogram cell.
 *
 * Next, the color-selection step begins with a box representing the whole
 * color space, and repeatedly splits the "largest" remaining box until we
 * have as many boxes as desired colors.  Then the mean color in each
 * remaining box becomes one of the possible output colors.
 * 
 * The second pass over the image maps each input pixel to the closest output
 * color (optionally after applying a Floyd-Steinberg dithering correction).
 * This mapping is logically trivial, but making it go fast enough requires
 * considerable care.
 *
 * Heckbert-style quantizers vary a good deal in their policies for choosing
 * the "largest" box and deciding where to cut it.  The particular policies
 * used here have proved out well in experimental comparisons, but better ones
 * may yet be found.
 *
 * In earlier versions of the IJG code, this module quantized in YCbCr color
 * space, processing the raw upsampled data without a color conversion step.
 * This allowed the color conversion math to be done only once per colormap
 * entry, not once per pixel.  However, that optimization precluded other
 * useful optimizations (such as merging color conversion with upsampling)
 * and it also interfered with desired capabilities such as quantizing to an
 * externally-supplied colormap.  We have therefore abandoned that approach.
 * The present code works in the post-conversion color space, typically RGB.
 *
 * To improve the visual quality of the results, we actually work in scaled
 * RGB space, giving G distances more weight than R, and R in turn more than
 * B.  To do everything in integer math, we must use integer scale factors.
 * The 2/3/1 scale factors used here correspond loosely to the relative
 * weights of the colors in the NTSC grayscale equation.
 * If you want to use this code to quantize a non-RGB color space, you'll
 * probably need to change these scale factors.
 */

/* Relabel R/G/B as components 0/1/2, respecting the RGB ordering defined

 * and B,G,R orders.  If you define some other weird order in jmorecfg.h,
 * you'll get compile errors until you extend this logic.  In that case
 * you'll probably want to tweak the histogram sizes too.

/*
 * First we have the histogram data structure and routines for creating it.
 *
 * The number of bits of precision can be adjusted by changing these symbols.
 * We recommend keeping 6 bits for G and 5 each for R and B.
 * If you have plenty of memory and cycles, 6 bits all around gives marginally
 * better results; if you are short of memory, 5 bits all around will save
 * some space but degrade the results.
 * To maintain a fully accurate histogram, we'd need to allocate a "long"
 * (preferably unsigned long) for each cell.  In practice this is overkill;
 * we can get by with 16 bits per cell.  Few of the cell counts will overflow,
 * and clamping those that do overflow to the maximum value will give close-
 * enough results.  This reduces the recommended histogram size from 256Kb
 * to 128Kb, which is a useful savings on PC-class machines.
 * (In the second pass the histogram space is re-used for pixel mapping data;
 * in that capacity, each cell must be able to store zero to the number of
 * desired colors.  16 bits/cell is plenty for that too.)
 * Since the JPEG code is intended to run in small memory model on 80x86
 * machines, we can't just allocate the histogram in one chunk.  Instead
 * of a true 3-D array, we use a row of pointers to 2-D arrays.  Each
 * pointer corresponds to a C0 value (typically 2^5 = 32 pointers) and
 * each 2-D array has 2^6*2^5 = 2048 or 2^6*2^6 = 4096 entries.  Note that
 * on 80x86 machines, the pointer row is in near memory but the actual
 * arrays are in far memory (same arrangement as we use for image arrays).

 *		...	(here)	7/16
 *		3/16	5/16	1/16
 * We work left-to-right on even rows, right-to-left on odd rows.
 *
 * We can get away with a single array (holding one row's worth of errors)
 * by using it to store the current row's errors at pixel columns not yet
 * processed, but the next row's errors at columns already processed.  We
 * need only a few extra variables to hold the errors immediately around the
 * current column.  (If we are lucky, those variables are in registers, but
 * even if not, they're probably cheaper to access than array elements are.)
 *
 * The fserrors[] array has (#columns + 2) entries; the extra entry at
 * each end saves us from special-casing the first and last pixels.
 * Each entry is three values long, one value for each color component.
 *
 * Note: on a wide image, we might not have enough room in a PC's near data

 * These routines are concerned with the time-critical task of mapping input
 * colors to the nearest color in the selected colormap.
 *
 * We re-use the histogram space as an "inverse color map", essentially a
 * cache for the results of nearest-color searches.  All colors within a
 * histogram cell will be mapped to the same colormap entry, namely the one
 * closest to the cell's center.  This may not be quite the closest entry to
 * the actual input color, but it's almost as good.  A zero in the cache
 * indicates we haven't found the nearest color for that cell yet; the array
 * is cleared to zeroes before starting the mapping pass.  When we find the
 * nearest color for a cell, its colormap index plus one is recorded in the
 * cache for future use.  The pass2 scanning routines call fill_inverse_cmap
 * when they need to use an unfilled entry in the cache.
 *
 * Our method of efficiently finding nearest colors is based on the "locally
 * sorted search" idea described by Heckbert and on the incremental distance
 * calculation described by Spencer W. Thomas in chapter III.1 of Graphics
 * Gems II (James Arvo, ed.  Academic Press, 1991).  Thomas points out that
 * the distances from a given colormap entry to each cell of the histogram can
 * be computed quickly using an incremental method: the differences between
 * distances to adjacent cells themselves differ by a constant.  This allows a
 * fairly fast implementation of the "brute force" approach of computing the
 * distance from every colormap entry to every histogram cell.  Unfortunately,
 * it needs a work array to hold the best-distance-so-far for each histogram
 * cell (because the inner loop has to be over cells, not colormap entries).
 * The work array elements have to be INT32s, so the work array would need
 * 256Kb at our recommended precision.  This is not feasible in DOS machines.
 *
 * To get around these problems, we apply Thomas' method to compute the
 * nearest colors for only the cells within a small subbox of the histogram.
 * The work array need be only as big as the subbox, so the memory usage
 * problem is solved.  Furthermore, we need not fill subboxes that are never
 * referenced in pass2; many images use only part of the color gamut, so a
 * fair amount of work is saved.  An additional advantage of this
 * approach is that we can apply Heckbert's locality criterion to quickly
 * eliminate colormap entries that are far away from the subbox; typically
 * three-fourths of the colormap entries are rejected by Heckbert's criterion,
 * and we need not compute their distances to individual cells in the subbox.
 * The speed of this approach is heavily influenced by the subbox size: too
 * small means too much overhead, too big loses because Heckbert's criterion
 * can't eliminate as many colormap entries.  Empirically the best subbox
 * size seems to be about 1/512th of the histogram (1/8th in each direction).
 *
 * Thomas' article also describes a refined method which is asymptotically
 * faster than the brute-force method, but it is also far more complex and
 * cannot efficiently be applied to small subboxes.  It is therefore not
 * useful for programs intended to be portable to DOS machines.  On machines
 * with plenty of memory, filling the whole histogram in one shot with Thomas'
 * refined method might be faster than the present code --- but then again,
 * it might not be any faster, and it's certainly more complicated.
