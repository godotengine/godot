 *
 * This file contains a fast, not so accurate integer implementation of the
 * inverse DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform).  In the IJG code, this routine
 * must also perform dequantization of the input coefficients.
 *
 * A 2-D IDCT can be done by 1-D IDCT on each column followed by 1-D IDCT
 * on each row (or vice versa, but it's more convenient to emit a row at
 * a time).  Direct algorithms are also available, but they are much more
 * complex and seem not to be any faster when reduced to code.
 *
 * This implementation is based on Arai, Agui, and Nakajima's algorithm for
 * scaled DCT.  Their original paper (Trans. IEICE E-71(11):1095) is in
 * Japanese, but the algorithm is described in the Pennebaker & Mitchell
 * JPEG textbook (see REFERENCES section in file README).  The following code
 * is based directly on figure 4-8 in P&M.
 * While an 8-point DCT cannot be done in less than 11 multiplies, it is
 * possible to arrange the computation so that many of the multiplies are
 * simple scalings of the final outputs.  These multiplies can then be
 * folded into the multiplications or divisions by the JPEG quantization
 * table entries.  The AA&N method leaves only 5 multiplies and 29 adds
 * to be done in the DCT itself.
 * The primary disadvantage of this method is that with fixed-point math,
 * accuracy is lost due to imprecise representation of the scaled
 * quantization values.  The smaller the quantization table entry, the less
 * precise the scaled value, so this implementation does worse with high-
 * quality-setting files than with low-quality ones.

/* Scaling decisions are generally the same as in the LL&M algorithm;
 * see jidctint.c for more details.  However, we choose to descale
 * (right shift) multiplication products as soon as they are formed,
 * rather than carrying additional fractional bits into subsequent additions.
 * This compromises accuracy slightly, but it lets us save a few shifts.
 * More importantly, 16-bit arithmetic is then adequate (for 8-bit samples)
 * everywhere except in the multiplications proper; this saves a good deal
 * of work on 16-bit-int machines.
 *
 * The dequantized coefficients are not integers because the AA&N scaling
 * factors have been incorporated.  We represent them scaled up by PASS1_BITS,
 * so that the first and second IDCT rounds have the same input scaling.
 * For 8-bit JSAMPLEs, we choose IFAST_SCALE_BITS = PASS1_BITS so as to
 * avoid a descaling shift; this compromises accuracy rather drastically
 * for small quantization table entries, but it saves a lot of shifts.
 * For 12-bit JSAMPLEs, there's no hope of using 16x16 multiplies anyway,
 * so we use a much larger scaling factor to preserve accuracy.
 *
 * A final compromise is to represent the multiplicative constants to only
 * 8 fractional bits, rather than 13.  This saves some shifting work on some
 * machines, and may also reduce the cost of multiplication (since there
 * are fewer one-bits in the constants).
