 *   11  for 11-bit sample values
 *   12  for 12-bit sample values
 * Only 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 bits sample data precision are supported for

 * later for the lossless modes of operation.
 * Run-time selection and conversion of data precision will be added later
 * and are currently not supported, sorry.
 * Exception:  The transcoding part (jpegtran) supports all settings in a
 * single instance, since it operates on the level of DCT coefficients and
 * not sample values.  The DCT coefficients are of the same type (16 bits)
 * in all cases (see below).
