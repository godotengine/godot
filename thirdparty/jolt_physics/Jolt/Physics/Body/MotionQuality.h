/// Motion quality, or how well it detects collisions when it has a high velocity
enum class EMotionQuality : uint8
{
	/// Update the body in discrete steps. Body will tunnel throuh thin objects if its velocity is high enough.
	/// This is the cheapest way of simulating a body.
	Discrete,

	/// Update the body using linear casting. When stepping the body, its collision shape is cast from
	/// start to destination using the starting rotation. The body will not be able to tunnel through thin
	/// objects at high velocity, but tunneling is still possible if the body is long and thin and has high
	/// angular velocity. Time is stolen from the object (which means it will move up to the first collision
	/// and will not bounce off the surface until the next integration step). This will make the body appear
	/// to go slower when it collides with high velocity. In order to not get stuck, the body is always
	/// allowed to move by a fraction of it's inner radius, which may eventually lead it to pass through geometry.
	///
	/// Note that if you're using a collision listener, you can receive contact added/persisted notifications of contacts
	/// that may in the end not happen. This happens between bodies that are using casting: If bodies A and B collide at t1
	/// and B and C collide at t2 where t2 < t1 and A and C don't collide. In this case you may receive an incorrect contact
	/// point added callback between A and B (which will be removed the next frame).
