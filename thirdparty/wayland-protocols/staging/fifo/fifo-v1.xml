    <description summary="protocol for fifo constraints">
      When a Wayland compositor considers applying a content update,
      it must ensure all the update's readiness constraints (fences, etc)
      are met.

      This protocol provides a way to use the completion of a display refresh
      cycle as an additional readiness constraint.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
      phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
      corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
      only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

        Establish a fifo object for a surface that may be used to add
        display refresh constraints to content updates.

        Only one such object may exist for a surface and attempting
        to create more than one will result in an already_exists
        protocol error. If a surface is acted on by multiple software
        components, general best practice is that only the component
        performing wl_surface.attach operations should use this protocol.

      <description summary="sets the start point for a fifo constraint">
        When the content update containing the "set_barrier" is applied,
        it sets a "fifo_barrier" condition on the surface associated with
        the fifo object. The condition is cleared immediately after the
        following latching deadline for non-tearing presentation.

        The compositor may clear the condition early if it must do so to
        ensure client forward progress assumptions.

        To wait for this condition to clear, use the "wait_barrier" request.

        "set_barrier" is double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.

        Requesting set_barrier after the fifo object's surface is
        destroyed will generate a "surface_destroyed" error.

    <request name="wait_barrier">
      <description summary="adds a fifo constraint to a content update">
        Indicate that this content update is not ready while a
        "fifo_barrier" condition is present on the surface.

        This means that when the content update containing "set_barrier"
        was made active at a latching deadline, it will be active for
        at least one refresh cycle. A content update which is allowed to
        tear might become active after a latching deadline if no content
        update became active at the deadline.

        The constraint must be ignored if the surface is a subsurface in
        synchronized mode. If the surface is not being updated by the
        compositor (off-screen, occluded) the compositor may ignore the
        constraint. Clients must use an additional mechanism such as
        frame callbacks or timestamps to ensure throttling occurs under
        all conditions.

        "wait_barrier" is double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.

        Requesting "wait_barrier" after the fifo object's surface is
        destroyed will generate a "surface_destroyed" error.
