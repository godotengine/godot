      This global interface enables clients to ring the system bell.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
      phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
      corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
      only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

      <description summary="ring the system bell">
	This requests rings the system bell on behalf of a client. How ringing
	the bell is implemented is up to the compositor. It may be an audible
	sound, a visual feedback of some kind, or any other thing including
	nothing.

        The passed surface should correspond to a toplevel like surface role,
        or be null, meaning the client doesn't have a particular toplevel it
        wants to associate the bell ringing with. See the xdg-shell protocol
        extension for a toplevel like surface role.
