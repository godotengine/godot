  <description summary="color management protocol">
    The aim of the color management extension is to allow clients to know
    the color properties of outputs, and to tell the compositor about the color
    properties of their content on surfaces. Doing this enables a compositor
    to perform automatic color management of content for different outputs
    according to how content is intended to look like.

    The color properties are represented as an image description object which
    is immutable after it has been created. A wl_output always has an
    associated image description that clients can observe. A wl_surface
    always has an associated preferred image description as a hint chosen by
    the compositor that clients can also observe. Clients can set an image
    description on a wl_surface to denote the color characteristics of the
    surface contents.

    An image description includes SDR and HDR colorimetry and encoding, HDR
    metadata, and viewing environment parameters. An image description does
    not include the properties set through color-representation extension.
    It is expected that the color-representation extension is used in
    conjunction with the color management extension when necessary,
    particularly with the YUV family of pixel formats.

    Recommendation ITU-T H.273
    "Coding-independent code points for video signal type identification"
    shall be referred to as simply H.273 here.

    The color-and-hdr repository
    (https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pq/color-and-hdr) contains
    background information on the protocol design and legacy color management.
    It also contains a glossary, learning resources for digital color, tools,
    samples and more.

    The terminology used in this protocol is based on common color science and
    color encoding terminology where possible. The glossary in the color-and-hdr
    repository shall be the authority on the definition of terms in this
    protocol.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
    phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
    corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
    only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

      <description summary="create Windows-scRGB image description object">
        This creates a pre-defined image description for the so-called
        Windows-scRGB stimulus encoding. This comes from the Windows 10 handling
        of its own definition of an scRGB color space for an HDR screen
        driven in BT.2100/PQ signalling mode.

        Windows-scRGB uses sRGB (BT.709) color primaries and white point.
        The transfer characteristic is extended linear.

        The nominal color channel value range is extended, meaning it includes
        negative and greater than 1.0 values. Negative values are used to
        escape the sRGB color gamut boundaries. To make use of the extended
        range, the client needs to use a pixel format that can represent those
        values, e.g. floating-point 16 bits per channel.

        Nominal color value R=G=B=0.0 corresponds to BT.2100/PQ system
        0 cd/m², and R=G=B=1.0 corresponds to BT.2100/PQ system 80 cd/m².
        The maximum is R=G=B=125.0 corresponding to 10k cd/m².

        Windows-scRGB is displayed by Windows 10 by converting it to
        BT.2100/PQ, maintaining the CIE 1931 chromaticity and mapping the
        luminance as above. No adjustment is made to the signal to account
        for the viewing conditions.

        The reference white level of Windows-scRGB is unknown. If a
        reference white level must be assumed for compositor processing, it
        should be R=G=B=2.5375 corresponding to 203 cd/m² of Report ITU-R
        BT.2408-7.

        The target color volume of Windows-scRGB is unknown. The color gamut
        may be anything between sRGB and BT.2100.

        Note: EGL_EXT_gl_colorspace_scrgb_linear definition differs from
        Windows-scRGB by using R=G=B=1.0 as the reference white level, while
        Windows-scRGB reference white level is unknown or varies. However,
        it seems probable that Windows implements both
        EGL_EXT_gl_colorspace_scrgb_linear and Vulkan
        VK_COLOR_SPACE_EXTENDED_SRGB_LINEAR_EXT as Windows-scRGB.

        This request can be used when the compositor advertises
        wp_color_manager_v1.feature.windows_scrgb.

        Set the image description of the underlying surface. The image
        description and rendering intent are double-buffered state, see
        wl_surface.commit.

        It is the client's responsibility to understand the image description
        it sets on a surface, and to provide content that matches that image
        description. Compositors might convert images to match their own or any
        other image descriptions.

        Image descriptions which are not ready (see wp_image_description_v1)
        are forbidden in this request, and in such case the protocol error
        image_description is raised.

        All image descriptions which are ready (see wp_image_description_v1)
        are allowed and must always be accepted by the compositor.

        A rendering intent provides the client's preference on how content
        colors should be mapped to each output. The render_intent value must
        be one advertised by the compositor with
        wp_color_manager_v1.render_intent event, otherwise the protocol error
        render_intent is raised.

        When an image description is set on a surface, the Transfer
        Characteristics of the image description defines the valid range of
        the nominal (real-valued) color channel values. The processing of
        out-of-range color channel values is undefined, but compositors are
        recommended to clamp the values to the valid range when possible.

        By default, a surface does not have an associated image description
        nor a rendering intent. The handling of color on such surfaces is
        compositor implementation defined. Compositors should handle such
        surfaces as sRGB, but may handle them differently if they have specific
        requirements.

        Setting the image description has copy semantics; after this request,
        the image description can be immediately destroyed without affecting
        the pending state of the surface.

        The protocol error invalid_luminance is raised if any of the following
        requirements is not met:
        - When max_cll is set, it must be greater than min L and less or equal

        - When max_fall is set, it must be greater than min L and less or equal

        luminance level. These values include the minimum display emission
        and ambient flare luminances, assumed to be optically additive and have
        the chromaticity of the primary color volume white point.

        The default luminances from
        https://www.color.org/chardata/rgb/srgb.xalter are
        - primary color volume minimum: 0.2 cd/m²
        - primary color volume maximum: 80 cd/m²
        - reference white: 80 cd/m²

        Setting a named transfer characteristic can imply other default
        luminances.

        The default luminances get overwritten when this request is used.
        With transfer_function.st2084_pq the given 'max_lum' value is ignored,
        and 'max_lum' is taken as 'min_lum' + 10000 cd/m².

        'min_lum' and 'max_lum' specify the minimum and maximum luminances of
        the primary color volume as reproduced by the targeted display.

        'reference_lum' specifies the luminance of the reference white as
        reproduced by the targeted display, and reflects the targeted viewing
        environment.

        Compositors should make sure that all content is anchored, meaning that
        an input signal level of 'reference_lum' on one image description and
        another input signal level of 'reference_lum' on another image
        description should produce the same output level, even though the
        'reference_lum' on both image representations can be different.

        'reference_lum' may be higher than 'max_lum'. In that case reaching
        the reference white output level in image content requires the
        'extended_target_volume' feature support.

        If 'max_lum' or 'reference_lum' are less than or equal to 'min_lum',
        the protocol error invalid_luminance is raised.

        The minimum luminance is multiplied by 10000 to get the argument

        Provides the color primaries and white point of the mastering display
        using CIE 1931 xy chromaticity coordinates. This is compatible with the
        SMPTE ST 2086 definition of HDR static metadata.

        The mastering display primaries and mastering display luminances define
        the target color volume.

        If mastering display primaries are not explicitly set, the target color
        volume is assumed to have the same primaries as the primary color volume.

        The target color volume is defined by all tristimulus values between 0.0
        and 1.0 (inclusive) of the color space defined by the given mastering
        display primaries and white point. The colorimetry is identical between
        the container color space and the mastering display color space,
        including that no chromatic adaptation is applied even if the white
        points differ.

        The target color volume can exceed the primary color volume to allow for
        a greater color volume with an existing color space definition (for
        example scRGB). It can be smaller than the primary color volume to
        minimize gamut and tone mapping distances for big color spaces (HDR
        metadata).

        To make use of the entire target color volume a suitable pixel format
        has to be chosen (e.g. floating point to exceed the primary color
        volume, or abusing limited quantization range as with xvYCC).

        Each coordinate value is multiplied by 1 million to get the argument
        value to carry precision of 6 decimals.

        If mastering display primaries have already been set on this object, the
        protocol error already_set is raised.

        This request can be used if the compositor advertises
        wp_color_manager_v1.feature.set_mastering_display_primaries. Otherwise

        wp_color_manager_v1.feature.extended_target_volume. If a client uses
        target color volume exceeding the primary color volume and the
        compositor does not support it, the result is implementation defined.
        Compositors are recommended to detect this case and fail the image
        description gracefully, but it may as well result in color artifacts.

        The color component transfer characteristic of this image description is
        a pure power curve. This event provides the exponent of the power
        function. This curve represents the conversion from electrical to
        optical pixel or color values.

        The curve exponent has been multiplied by 10000 to get the argument eexp
        value to carry the precision of 4 decimals.

    <event name="luminances">
      <description summary="primary color volume luminance range and reference white">
        Delivers the primary color volume luminance range and the reference
        white luminance level. These values include the minimum display emission
        and ambient flare luminances, assumed to be optically additive and have
        the chromaticity of the primary color volume white point.

        The minimum luminance is multiplied by 10000 to get the argument
        'min_lum' value and carries precision of 4 decimals. The maximum
        luminance and reference white luminance values are unscaled.

    <event name="target_primaries">
      <description summary="target primaries as chromaticity coordinates">
        Provides the color primaries and white point of the target color volume
        using CIE 1931 xy chromaticity coordinates. This is compatible with the
        SMPTE ST 2086 definition of HDR static metadata for mastering displays.

        While primary color volume is about how color is encoded, the target
        color volume is the actually displayable color volume. If target color
        volume is equal to the primary color volume, then this event is not
        sent.

        Each coordinate value is multiplied by 1 million to get the argument
        value to carry precision of 6 decimals.
