  <interface name="zwp_linux_explicit_synchronization_v1" version="2">
    <description summary="protocol for providing explicit synchronization">
      This global is a factory interface, allowing clients to request
      explicit synchronization for buffers on a per-surface basis.

      See zwp_linux_surface_synchronization_v1 for more information.

      This interface is derived from Chromium's
      zcr_linux_explicit_synchronization_v1.

      Note: this protocol is superseded by linux-drm-syncobj.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
      backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
      may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
      Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
      the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
      Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
      version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
      interface version number is reset.

        If the given wl_surface already has an explicit synchronization object

        Graphics APIs, like EGL or Vulkan, that manage the buffer queue and
        commits of a wl_surface themselves, are likely to be using this
        extension internally. If a client is using such an API for a
        wl_surface, it should not directly use this extension on that surface,
        to avoid raising a synchronization_exists protocol error.

    <description summary="per-surface explicit synchronization support">
      This object implements per-surface explicit synchronization.

      Synchronization refers to co-ordination of pipelined operations performed
      on buffers. Most GPU clients will schedule an asynchronous operation to
      render to the buffer, then immediately send the buffer to the compositor
      to be attached to a surface.

      In implicit synchronization, ensuring that the rendering operation is
      complete before the compositor displays the buffer is an implementation
      detail handled by either the kernel or userspace graphics driver.

      By contrast, in explicit synchronization, dma_fence objects mark when the
      asynchronous operations are complete. When submitting a buffer, the
      client provides an acquire fence which will be waited on before the
      compositor accesses the buffer. The Wayland server, through a
      zwp_linux_buffer_release_v1 object, will inform the client with an event
      which may be accompanied by a release fence, when the compositor will no
      longer access the buffer contents due to the specific commit that
      requested the release event.

      Each surface can be associated with only one object of this interface at
      any time.

      In version 1 of this interface, explicit synchronization is only
      guaranteed to be supported for buffers created with any version of the
      wp_linux_dmabuf buffer factory. Version 2 additionally guarantees
      explicit synchronization support for opaque EGL buffers, which is a type
      of platform specific buffers described in the EGL_WL_bind_wayland_display
      extension. Compositors are free to support explicit synchronization for
      additional buffer types.

        is a dma_fence kernel object.

        The acquire fence is double-buffered state, and will be applied on the
        next wl_surface.commit request for the associated surface. Thus, it
        applies only to the buffer that is attached to the surface at commit

      This object is instantiated in response to a
      zwp_linux_surface_synchronization_v1.get_release request.

      It provides an alternative to wl_buffer.release events, providing a
      unique release from a single wl_surface.commit request. The release event
      also supports explicit synchronization, providing a fence FD for the
      client to synchronize against.

      Exactly one event, either a fenced_release or an immediate_release, will
      be emitted for the wl_surface.commit request. The compositor can choose
      release by release which event it uses.

      This event does not replace wl_buffer.release events; servers are still
      required to send those events.

      Once a buffer release object has delivered a 'fenced_release' or an
      'immediate_release' event it is automatically destroyed.

        signaled when all operations by the compositor on that buffer for that
        commit have finished.

        Once the fence has signaled, and assuming the associated buffer is not
        pending release from other wl_surface.commit requests, no additional
        explicit or implicit synchronization is required to safely reuse or
        destroy the buffer.

        that commit have finished.

        Once this event is received, and assuming the associated buffer is not
        pending release from other wl_surface.commit requests, no additional

        destroy the buffer.
