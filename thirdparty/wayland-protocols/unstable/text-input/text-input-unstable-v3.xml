  <description summary="Protocol for composing text">
    This protocol allows compositors to act as input methods and to send text
    to applications. A text input object is used to manage state of what are
    typically text entry fields in the application.

    This document adheres to the RFC 2119 when using words like "must",
    "should", "may", etc.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
    backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
    may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
    Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
    the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
    Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
    version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
    interface version number is reset.

  <interface name="zwp_text_input_v3" version="1">
    <description summary="text input">
      The zwp_text_input_v3 interface represents text input and input methods
      associated with a seat. It provides enter/leave events to follow the
      text input focus for a seat.

      Requests are used to enable/disable the text-input object and set
      state information like surrounding and selected text or the content type.
      The information about the entered text is sent to the text-input object
      via the preedit_string and commit_string events.

      Text is valid UTF-8 encoded, indices and lengths are in bytes. Indices
      must not point to middle bytes inside a code point: they must either
      point to the first byte of a code point or to the end of the buffer.
      Lengths must be measured between two valid indices.

      Focus moving throughout surfaces will result in the emission of
      zwp_text_input_v3.enter and zwp_text_input_v3.leave events. The focused
      surface must commit zwp_text_input_v3.enable and
      zwp_text_input_v3.disable requests as the keyboard focus moves across
      editable and non-editable elements of the UI. Those two requests are not
      expected to be paired with each other, the compositor must be able to
      handle consecutive series of the same request.

      State is sent by the state requests (set_surrounding_text,
      set_content_type and set_cursor_rectangle) and a commit request. After an
      enter event or disable request all state information is invalidated and
      needs to be resent by the client.

    <request name="destroy" type="destructor">
      <description summary="Destroy the wp_text_input">
        Destroy the wp_text_input object. Also disables all surfaces enabled
        through this wp_text_input object.
      </description>
    </request>

    <request name="enable">
      <description summary="Request text input to be enabled">
        Requests text input on the surface previously obtained from the enter
        event.

        This request must be issued every time the focused text input changes
        to a new one, including within the current surface. Use
        zwp_text_input_v3.disable when there is no longer any input focus on
        the current surface.

        Clients must not enable more than one text input on the single seat
        and should disable the current text input before enabling the new one.
        Requests to enable a text input when another text input is enabled
        on the same seat must be ignored by compositor.

        This request resets all state associated with previous enable, disable,
        set_surrounding_text, set_text_change_cause, set_content_type, and
        set_cursor_rectangle requests, as well as the state associated with
        preedit_string, commit_string, and delete_surrounding_text events.

        The set_surrounding_text, set_content_type and set_cursor_rectangle
        requests must follow if the text input supports the necessary
        functionality.

        State set with this request is double-buffered. It will get applied on
        the next zwp_text_input_v3.commit request, and stay valid until the
        next committed enable or disable request.

        The changes must be applied by the compositor after issuing a
        zwp_text_input_v3.commit request.

        there is no focus on any text entry inside the surface).

        the next zwp_text_input_v3.commit request.

    <request name="set_surrounding_text">
      <description summary="sets the surrounding text">
        Sets the surrounding plain text around the input, excluding the preedit
        text.

        The client should notify the compositor of any changes in any of the
        values carried with this request, including changes caused by handling
        incoming text-input events as well as changes caused by other
        mechanisms like keyboard typing.

        If the client is unaware of the text around the cursor, it should not
        issue this request, to signify lack of support to the compositor.

        Text is UTF-8 encoded, and should include the cursor position, the
        complete selection and additional characters before and after them.
        There is a maximum length of wayland messages, so text can not be
        longer than 4000 bytes.

        Cursor is the byte offset of the cursor within text buffer.

        Anchor is the byte offset of the selection anchor within text buffer.
        If there is no selected text, anchor is the same as cursor.

        If any preedit text is present, it is replaced with a cursor for the
        purpose of this event.

        Values set with this request are double-buffered. They will get applied
        on the next zwp_text_input_v3.commit request, and stay valid until the
        next committed enable or disable request.

        The initial state for affected fields is empty, meaning that the text
        input does not support sending surrounding text. If the empty values
        get applied, subsequent attempts to change them may have no effect.

    <request name="commit">

        Atomically applies state changes recently sent to the compositor.

        The commit request establishes and updates the state of the client, and
        must be issued after any changes to apply them.

        Text input state (enabled status, content purpose, content hint,
        surrounding text and change cause, cursor rectangle) is conceptually
        double-buffered within the context of a text input, i.e. between a
        committed enable request and the following committed enable or disable
        request.

        Protocol requests modify the pending state, as opposed to the current
        state in use by the input method. A commit request atomically applies
        all pending state, replacing the current state. After commit, the new
        pending state is as documented for each related request.

        Requests are applied in the order of arrival.

        Neither current nor pending state are modified unless noted otherwise.

        The compositor must count the number of commit requests coming from
        each zwp_text_input_v3 object and use the count as the serial in done
        events.

        modifies the pending state. This event replaces the current state with
        the pending state.

        The application must proceed by evaluating the changes in the following
        order:

        1. Replace existing preedit string with the cursor.
        2. Delete requested surrounding text.
        3. Insert commit string with the cursor at its end.
        4. Calculate surrounding text to send.
        5. Insert new preedit text in cursor position.
        6. Place cursor inside preedit text.

        The serial number reflects the last state of the zwp_text_input_v3
        object known to the compositor. The value of the serial argument must
        be equal to the number of commit requests already issued on that object.

        When the client receives a done event with a serial different than the
        number of past commit requests, it must proceed with evaluating and
        applying the changes as normal, except it should not change the current
        state of the zwp_text_input_v3 object. All pending state requests
        (set_surrounding_text, set_content_type and set_cursor_rectangle) on
