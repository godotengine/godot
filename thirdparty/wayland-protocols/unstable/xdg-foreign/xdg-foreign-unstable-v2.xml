  <description summary="Protocol for exporting xdg surface handles">
    This protocol specifies a way for making it possible to reference a surface
    of a different client. With such a reference, a client can, by using the
    interfaces provided by this protocol, manipulate the relationship between
    its own surfaces and the surface of some other client. For example, stack
    some of its own surface above the other clients surface.

    In order for a client A to get a reference of a surface of client B, client
    B must first export its surface using xdg_exporter.export_toplevel. Upon
    doing this, client B will receive a handle (a unique string) that it may
    share with client A in some way (for example D-Bus). After client A has
    received the handle from client B, it may use xdg_importer.import_toplevel
    to create a reference to the surface client B just exported. See the
    corresponding requests for details.

    A possible use case for this is out-of-process dialogs. For example when a
    sandboxed client without file system access needs the user to select a file
    on the file system, given sandbox environment support, it can export its
    surface, passing the exported surface handle to an unsandboxed process that
    can show a file browser dialog and stack it above the sandboxed client's
    surface.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and backward
    incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes may be added
    together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward
    incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in the protocol
    and interface names and resetting the interface version. Once the protocol
    is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the version number in the
    protocol and interface names are removed and the interface version number is
    reset.
