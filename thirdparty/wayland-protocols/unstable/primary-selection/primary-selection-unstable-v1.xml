  <description summary="Primary selection protocol">
    This protocol provides the ability to have a primary selection device to
    match that of the X server. This primary selection is a shortcut to the
    common clipboard selection, where text just needs to be selected in order
    to allow copying it elsewhere. The de facto way to perform this action
    is the middle mouse button, although it is not limited to this one.

    Clients wishing to honor primary selection should create a primary
    selection source and set it as the selection through
    wp_primary_selection_device.set_selection whenever the text selection
    changes. In order to minimize calls in pointer-driven text selection,
    it should happen only once after the operation finished. Similarly,
    a NULL source should be set when text is unselected.

    wp_primary_selection_offer objects are first announced through the
    wp_primary_selection_device.data_offer event. Immediately after this event,
    the primary data offer will emit wp_primary_selection_offer.offer events
    to let know of the mime types being offered.

    When the primary selection changes, the client with the keyboard focus
    will receive wp_primary_selection_device.selection events. Only the client
    with the keyboard focus will receive such events with a non-NULL
    wp_primary_selection_offer. Across keyboard focus changes, previously
    focused clients will receive wp_primary_selection_device.events with a
    NULL wp_primary_selection_offer.

    In order to request the primary selection data, the client must pass
    a recent serial pertaining to the press event that is triggering the
    operation, if the compositor deems the serial valid and recent, the
    wp_primary_selection_source.send event will happen in the other end
    to let the transfer begin. The client owning the primary selection
    should write the requested data, and close the file descriptor
    immediately.

    If the primary selection owner client disappeared during the transfer,
    the client reading the data will receive a
    wp_primary_selection_device.selection event with a NULL
    wp_primary_selection_offer, the client should take this as a hint
    to finish the reads related to the no longer existing offer.

    The primary selection owner should be checking for errors during
    writes, merely cancelling the ongoing transfer if any happened.

      A wp_primary_selection_offer represents an offer to transfer the contents
      of the primary selection clipboard to the client. Similar to
      wl_data_offer, the offer also describes the mime types that the data can

        To transfer the contents of the primary selection clipboard, the client
        issues this request and indicates the mime type that it wants to

        (typically created with the pipe system call). The source client writes
        the data in the mime type representation requested and then closes the
        file descriptor.

        The receiving client reads from the read end of the pipe until EOF and
        closes its end, at which point the transfer is complete.
