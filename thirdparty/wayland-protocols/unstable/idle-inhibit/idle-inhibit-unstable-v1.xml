  <interface name="zwp_idle_inhibit_manager_v1" version="1">
    <description summary="control behavior when display idles">
      This interface permits inhibiting the idle behavior such as screen
      blanking, locking, and screensaving.  The client binds the idle manager
      globally, then creates idle-inhibitor objects for each surface.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
      backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
      may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
      Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
      the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
      Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
      version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
      interface version number is reset.

    <description summary="context object for inhibiting idle behavior">
      An idle inhibitor prevents the output that the associated surface is
      visible on from being set to a state where it is not visually usable due
      to lack of user interaction (e.g. blanked, dimmed, locked, set to power
      save, etc.)  Any screensaver processes are also blocked from displaying.

      If the surface is destroyed, unmapped, becomes occluded, loses
      visibility, or otherwise becomes not visually relevant for the user, the
      idle inhibitor will not be honored by the compositor; if the surface
      subsequently regains visibility the inhibitor takes effect once again.
      Likewise, the inhibitor isn't honored if the system was already idled at
      the time the inhibitor was established, although if the system later
      de-idles and re-idles the inhibitor will take effect.
