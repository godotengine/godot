  <interface name="zxdg_decoration_manager_v1" version="1">
    <description summary="window decoration manager">
      This interface allows a compositor to announce support for server-side
      decorations.

      A window decoration is a set of window controls as deemed appropriate by
      the party managing them, such as user interface components used to move,
      resize and change a window's state.

      A client can use this protocol to request being decorated by a supporting
      compositor.

      If compositor and client do not negotiate the use of a server-side
      decoration using this protocol, clients continue to self-decorate as they
      see fit.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
      backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
      may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
      Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
      the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
      Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
      version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
      interface version number is reset.

      <description summary="set the decoration mode">
        Set the toplevel surface decoration mode. This informs the compositor
        that the client prefers the provided decoration mode.

        After requesting a decoration mode, the compositor will respond by
        emitting an xdg_surface.configure event. The client should then update
        its content, drawing it without decorations if the received mode is
        server-side decorations. The client must also acknowledge the configure
        when committing the new content (see xdg_surface.ack_configure).

        The compositor can decide not to use the client's mode and enforce a
        different mode instead.

        Clients whose decoration mode depend on the xdg_toplevel state may send
        a set_mode request in response to an xdg_surface.configure event and wait
        for the next xdg_surface.configure event to prevent unwanted state.
        Such clients are responsible for preventing configure loops and must
        make sure not to send multiple successive set_mode requests with the
        same decoration mode.

        Unset the toplevel surface decoration mode. This informs the compositor

        This request has the same semantics as set_mode.

    <event name="configure">

        The configure event configures the effective decoration mode. The

        ack_configure in response to this event. See xdg_surface.configure and
        xdg_surface.ack_configure for details.

        A configure event can be sent at any time. The specified mode must be
        obeyed by the client.
