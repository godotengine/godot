    <description summary="child surface positioner">
      The xdg_positioner provides a collection of rules for the placement of a
      child surface relative to a parent surface. Rules can be defined to ensure
      the child surface remains within the visible area's borders, and to
      specify how the child surface changes its position, such as sliding along
      an axis, or flipping around a rectangle. These positioner-created rules are
      constrained by the requirement that a child surface must intersect with or
      be at least partially adjacent to its parent surface.

      See the various requests for details about possible rules.

      At the time of the request, the compositor makes a copy of the rules
      specified by the xdg_positioner. Thus, after the request is complete the
      xdg_positioner object can be destroyed or reused; further changes to the
      object will have no effect on previous usages.

      For an xdg_positioner object to be considered complete, it must have a
      non-zero size set by set_size, and a non-zero anchor rectangle set by
      set_anchor_rect. Passing an incomplete xdg_positioner object when
      positioning a surface raises an invalid_positioner error.

    <description summary="desktop user interface surface base interface">
      An interface that may be implemented by a wl_surface, for
      implementations that provide a desktop-style user interface.

      It provides a base set of functionality required to construct user
      interface elements requiring management by the compositor, such as
      toplevel windows, menus, etc. The types of functionality are split into
      xdg_surface roles.

      Creating an xdg_surface does not set the role for a wl_surface. In order
      to map an xdg_surface, the client must create a role-specific object
      using, e.g., get_toplevel, get_popup. The wl_surface for any given
      xdg_surface can have at most one role, and may not be assigned any role
      not based on xdg_surface.

      A role must be assigned before any other requests are made to the
      xdg_surface object.

      The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
      for the xdg_surface state to take effect.

      Creating an xdg_surface from a wl_surface which has a buffer attached or
      committed is a client error, and any attempts by a client to attach or
      manipulate a buffer prior to the first xdg_surface.configure call must
      also be treated as errors.

      After creating a role-specific object and setting it up, the client must
      perform an initial commit without any buffer attached. The compositor
      will reply with initial wl_surface state such as
      wl_surface.preferred_buffer_scale followed by an xdg_surface.configure
      event. The client must acknowledge it and is then allowed to attach a
      buffer to map the surface.

      Mapping an xdg_surface-based role surface is defined as making it
      possible for the surface to be shown by the compositor. Note that
      a mapped surface is not guaranteed to be visible once it is mapped.

      For an xdg_surface to be mapped by the compositor, the following
      conditions must be met:
      (1) the client has assigned an xdg_surface-based role to the surface
      (2) the client has set and committed the xdg_surface state and the
	  role-dependent state to the surface
      (3) the client has committed a buffer to the surface

      A newly-unmapped surface is considered to have met condition (1) out
      of the 3 required conditions for mapping a surface if its role surface
      has not been destroyed, i.e. the client must perform the initial commit
      again before attaching a buffer.

	The window geometry of a surface is its "visible bounds" from the

	purposes of aligning, placing and constraining windows.

	The window geometry is double buffered, and will be applied at the
	time wl_surface.commit of the corresponding wl_surface is called.

	When maintaining a position, the compositor should treat the (x, y)
	coordinate of the window geometry as the top left corner of the window.
	A client changing the (x, y) window geometry coordinate should in
	general not alter the position of the window.

	Once the window geometry of the surface is set, it is not possible to
	unset it, and it will remain the same until set_window_geometry is
	called again, even if a new subsurface or buffer is attached.

	If never set, the value is the full bounds of the surface,
	including any subsurfaces. This updates dynamically on every
	commit. This unset is meant for extremely simple clients.

	The arguments are given in the surface-local coordinate space of
	the wl_surface associated with this xdg_surface, and may extend outside
	of the wl_surface itself to mark parts of the subsurface tree as part of
	the window geometry.

	When applied, the effective window geometry will be the set window
	geometry clamped to the bounding rectangle of the combined
	geometry of the surface of the xdg_surface and the associated
	subsurfaces.

	The effective geometry will not be recalculated unless a new call to
	set_window_geometry is done and the new pending surface state is
	subsequently applied.

	The width and height of the effective window geometry must be
	greater than zero. Setting an invalid size will raise an

    <request name="ack_configure">
      <description summary="ack a configure event">
	When a configure event is received, if a client commits the
	surface in response to the configure event, then the client
	must make an ack_configure request sometime before the commit
	request, passing along the serial of the configure event.

	For instance, for toplevel surfaces the compositor might use this
	information to move a surface to the top left only when the client has
	drawn itself for the maximized or fullscreen state.

	If the client receives multiple configure events before it
	can respond to one, it only has to ack the last configure event.
	Acking a configure event that was never sent raises an invalid_serial
	error.

	A client is not required to commit immediately after sending
	an ack_configure request - it may even ack_configure several times
	before its next surface commit.

	A client may send multiple ack_configure requests before committing, but
	only the last request sent before a commit indicates which configure
	event the client really is responding to.

  <interface name="xdg_toplevel" version="6">
    <description summary="toplevel surface">
      This interface defines an xdg_surface role which allows a surface to,
      among other things, set window-like properties such as maximize,
      fullscreen, and minimize, set application-specific metadata like title and
      id, and well as trigger user interactive operations such as interactive
      resize and move.

      A xdg_toplevel by default is responsible for providing the full intended
      visual representation of the toplevel, which depending on the window
      state, may mean things like a title bar, window controls and drop shadow.

      Unmapping an xdg_toplevel means that the surface cannot be shown
      by the compositor until it is explicitly mapped again.
      All active operations (e.g., move, resize) are canceled and all
      attributes (e.g. title, state, stacking, ...) are discarded for
      an xdg_toplevel surface when it is unmapped. The xdg_toplevel returns to
      the state it had right after xdg_surface.get_toplevel. The client
      can re-map the toplevel by perfoming a commit without any buffer
      attached, waiting for a configure event and handling it as usual (see
      xdg_surface description).

      Attaching a null buffer to a toplevel unmaps the surface.

      unmap the surface. Clients that want to dismiss the popup when another
      surface of their own is clicked should dismiss the popup using the destroy
      request.

      A newly created xdg_popup will be stacked on top of all previously created
      xdg_popup surfaces associated with the same xdg_toplevel.

      The parent of an xdg_popup must be mapped (see the xdg_surface
      description) before the xdg_popup itself.

      The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
      for the xdg_popup state to take effect.

    <request name="grab">
      <description summary="make the popup take an explicit grab">
	This request makes the created popup take an explicit grab. An explicit
	grab will be dismissed when the user dismisses the popup, or when the
	client destroys the xdg_popup. This can be done by the user clicking
	outside the surface, using the keyboard, or even locking the screen
	through closing the lid or a timeout.

	If the compositor denies the grab, the popup will be immediately
	dismissed.

	This request must be used in response to some sort of user action like a
	button press, key press, or touch down event. The serial number of the
	event should be passed as 'serial'.

	The parent of a grabbing popup must either be an xdg_toplevel surface or
	another xdg_popup with an explicit grab. If the parent is another
	xdg_popup it means that the popups are nested, with this popup now being
	the topmost popup.

	Nested popups must be destroyed in the reverse order they were created
	in, e.g. the only popup you are allowed to destroy at all times is the
	topmost one.

	When compositors choose to dismiss a popup, they may dismiss every
	nested grabbing popup as well. When a compositor dismisses popups, it
	will follow the same dismissing order as required from the client.

	If the topmost grabbing popup is destroyed, the grab will be returned to
	the parent of the popup, if that parent previously had an explicit grab.

	If the parent is a grabbing popup which has already been dismissed, this
	popup will be immediately dismissed. If the parent is a popup that did
	not take an explicit grab, an error will be raised.

	During a popup grab, the client owning the grab will receive pointer
	and touch events for all their surfaces as normal (similar to an
	"owner-events" grab in X11 parlance), while the top most grabbing popup
	will always have keyboard focus.

	Reposition an already-mapped popup. The popup will be placed given the
	details in the passed xdg_positioner object, and a
	xdg_popup.repositioned followed by xdg_popup.configure and
	xdg_surface.configure will be emitted in response. Any parameters set
	by the previous positioner will be discarded.

	The passed token will be sent in the corresponding
	xdg_popup.repositioned event. The new popup position will not take
	effect until the corresponding configure event is acknowledged by the
	client. See xdg_popup.repositioned for details. The token itself is
	opaque, and has no other special meaning.

	If multiple reposition requests are sent, the compositor may skip all
	but the last one.

	If the popup is repositioned in response to a configure event for its
	parent, the client should send an xdg_positioner.set_parent_configure
	and possibly an xdg_positioner.set_parent_size request to allow the
	compositor to properly constrain the popup.

	If the popup is repositioned together with a parent that is being
	resized, but not in response to a configure event, the client should
	send an xdg_positioner.set_parent_size request.

	The repositioned event is sent as part of a popup configuration

	The repositioned event is to notify about the completion of a

	in the xdg_popup.reposition request.

	Immediately after this event is emitted, xdg_popup.configure and
	xdg_surface.configure will be sent with the updated size and position,
	as well as a new configure serial.

	The client should optionally update the content of the popup, but must
	acknowledge the new popup configuration for the new position to take
	effect. See xdg_surface.ack_configure for details.
