    <description summary="surface cropping and scaling">
      The global interface exposing surface cropping and scaling
      capabilities is used to instantiate an interface extension for a
      wl_surface object. This extended interface will then allow
      cropping and scaling the surface contents, effectively
      disconnecting the direct relationship between the buffer and the
      surface size.

    <description summary="crop and scale interface to a wl_surface">
      An additional interface to a wl_surface object, which allows the
      client to specify the cropping and scaling of the surface
      contents.

      This interface works with two concepts: the source rectangle (src_x,
      src_y, src_width, src_height), and the destination size (dst_width,
      dst_height). The contents of the source rectangle are scaled to the
      destination size, and content outside the source rectangle is ignored.
      This state is double-buffered, see wl_surface.commit.

      The two parts of crop and scale state are independent: the source
      rectangle, and the destination size. Initially both are unset, that
      is, no scaling is applied. The whole of the current wl_buffer is
      used as the source, and the surface size is as defined in
      wl_surface.attach.

      If the destination size is set, it causes the surface size to become
      dst_width, dst_height. The source (rectangle) is scaled to exactly
      this size. This overrides whatever the attached wl_buffer size is,
      unless the wl_buffer is NULL. If the wl_buffer is NULL, the surface
      has no content and therefore no size. Otherwise, the size is always
      at least 1x1 in surface local coordinates.

      If the source rectangle is set, it defines what area of the wl_buffer is
      taken as the source. If the source rectangle is set and the destination
      size is not set, then src_width and src_height must be integers, and the
      surface size becomes the source rectangle size. This results in cropping
      without scaling. If src_width or src_height are not integers and
      destination size is not set, the bad_size protocol error is raised when
      the surface state is applied.

      The coordinate transformations from buffer pixel coordinates up to
      the surface-local coordinates happen in the following order:
        1. buffer_transform (wl_surface.set_buffer_transform)
        2. buffer_scale (wl_surface.set_buffer_scale)
        3. crop and scale (wp_viewport.set*)
      This means, that the source rectangle coordinates of crop and scale
      are given in the coordinates after the buffer transform and scale,
      i.e. in the coordinates that would be the surface-local coordinates
      if the crop and scale was not applied.

      If src_x or src_y are negative, the bad_value protocol error is raised.
      Otherwise, if the source rectangle is partially or completely outside of
      the non-NULL wl_buffer, then the out_of_buffer protocol error is raised
      when the surface state is applied. A NULL wl_buffer does not raise the
      out_of_buffer error.

      If the wl_surface associated with the wp_viewport is destroyed,
      all wp_viewport requests except 'destroy' raise the protocol error
      no_surface.

      If the wp_viewport object is destroyed, the crop and scale
      state is removed from the wl_surface. The change will be applied
      on the next wl_surface.commit.
