  <description summary="Wayland protocol for graphics tablets">
    This description provides a high-level overview of the interplay between
    the interfaces defined this protocol. For details, see the protocol
    specification.

    More than one tablet may exist, and device-specifics matter. Tablets are
    not represented by a single virtual device like wl_pointer. A client
    binds to the tablet manager object which is just a proxy object. From
    that, the client requests zwp_tablet_manager_v2.get_tablet_seat(wl_seat)
    and that returns the actual interface that has all the tablets. With
    this indirection, we can avoid merging zwp_tablet_v2 into the actual Wayland
    protocol, a long-term benefit.

    The zwp_tablet_seat_v2 sends a "tablet added" event for each tablet
    connected. That event is followed by descriptive events about the
    hardware; currently that includes events for name, vid/pid and
    a zwp_tablet_v2.path event that describes a local path. This path can be
    used to uniquely identify a tablet or get more information through
    libwacom. Emulated or nested tablets can skip any of those, e.g. a
    virtual tablet may not have a vid/pid. The sequence of descriptive
    events is terminated by a zwp_tablet_v2.done event to signal that a client
    may now finalize any initialization for that tablet.

    Events from tablets require a tool in proximity. Tools are also managed
    by the tablet seat; a "tool added" event is sent whenever a tool is new
    to the compositor. That event is followed by a number of descriptive
    events about the hardware; currently that includes capabilities,
    hardware id and serial number, and tool type. Similar to the tablet
    interface, a zwp_tablet_tool_v2.done event is sent to terminate that initial
    sequence.

    Any event from a tool happens on the zwp_tablet_tool_v2 interface. When the
    tool gets into proximity of the tablet, a proximity_in event is sent on
    the zwp_tablet_tool_v2 interface, listing the tablet and the surface. That
    event is followed by a motion event with the coordinates. After that,
    it's the usual motion, axis, button, etc. events. The protocol's
    serialisation means events are grouped by zwp_tablet_tool_v2.frame events.

    Two special events (that don't exist in X) are down and up. They signal
    "tip touching the surface". For tablets without real proximity
    detection, the sequence is: proximity_in, motion, down, frame.

    When the tool leaves proximity, a proximity_out event is sent. If any
    button is still down, a button release event is sent before this
    proximity event. These button events are sent in the same frame as the
    proximity event to signal to the client that the buttons were held when
    the tool left proximity.

    If the tool moves out of the surface but stays in proximity (i.e.
    between windows), compositor-specific grab policies apply. This usually
    means that the proximity-out is delayed until all buttons are released.

    Moving a tool physically from one tablet to the other has no real effect
    on the protocol, since we already have the tool object from the "tool
    added" event. All the information is already there and the proximity
    events on both tablets are all a client needs to reconstruct what
    happened.

    Some extra axes are normalized, i.e. the client knows the range as
    specified in the protocol (e.g. [0, 65535]), the granularity however is
    unknown. The current normalized axes are pressure, distance, and slider.

    Other extra axes are in physical units as specified in the protocol.
    The current extra axes with physical units are tilt, rotation and
    wheel rotation.

    Since tablets work independently of the pointer controlled by the mouse,
    the focus handling is independent too and controlled by proximity.
    The zwp_tablet_tool_v2.set_cursor request sets a tool-specific cursor.
    This cursor surface may be the same as the mouse cursor, and it may be
    the same across tools but it is possible to be more fine-grained. For
    example, a client may set different cursors for the pen and eraser.

    Tools are generally independent of tablets and it is
    compositor-specific policy when a tool can be removed. Common approaches
    will likely include some form of removing a tool when all tablets the
    tool was used on are removed.

    <description summary="a physical tablet tool">
      An object that represents a physical tool that has been, or is
      currently in use with a tablet in this seat. Each zwp_tablet_tool_v2
      object stays valid until the client destroys it; the compositor
      reuses the zwp_tablet_tool_v2 object to indicate that the object's
      respective physical tool has come into proximity of a tablet again.

      A zwp_tablet_tool_v2 object's relation to a physical tool depends on the
      tablet's ability to report serial numbers. If the tablet supports
      this capability, then the object represents a specific physical tool
      and can be identified even when used on multiple tablets.

      A tablet tool has a number of static characteristics, e.g. tool type,
      hardware_serial and capabilities. These capabilities are sent in an
      event sequence after the zwp_tablet_seat_v2.tool_added event before any
      actual events from this tool. This initial event sequence is
      terminated by a zwp_tablet_tool_v2.done event.

      Tablet tool events are grouped by zwp_tablet_tool_v2.frame events.
      Any events received before a zwp_tablet_tool_v2.frame event should be
      considered part of the same hardware state change.

	Sets the surface of the cursor used for this tool on the given

	of one of the requesting client's surfaces or the surface parameter
	is the current pointer surface. If there was a previous surface set
	with this request it is replaced. If surface is NULL, the cursor
	image is hidden.

	The parameters hotspot_x and hotspot_y define the position of the
	pointer surface relative to the pointer location. Its top-left corner
	is always at (x, y) - (hotspot_x, hotspot_y), where (x, y) are the
	coordinates of the pointer location, in surface-local coordinates.

	On surface.attach requests to the pointer surface, hotspot_x and
	hotspot_y are decremented by the x and y parameters passed to the
	request. Attach must be confirmed by wl_surface.commit as usual.

	The hotspot can also be updated by passing the currently set pointer
	surface to this request with new values for hotspot_x and hotspot_y.

	The current and pending input regions of the wl_surface are cleared,
	and wl_surface.set_input_region is ignored until the wl_surface is no
	longer used as the cursor. When the use as a cursor ends, the current
	and pending input regions become undefined, and the wl_surface is
	unmapped.

	This request gives the surface the role of a zwp_tablet_tool_v2 cursor. A
	surface may only ever be used as the cursor surface for one
	zwp_tablet_tool_v2. If the surface already has another role or has
	previously been used as cursor surface for a different tool, a
	protocol error is raised.

      The zwp_tablet_v2 interface represents one graphics tablet device. The
      tablet interface itself does not generate events; all events are
      generated by zwp_tablet_tool_v2 objects when in proximity above a tablet.

      A tablet has a number of static characteristics, e.g. device name and
      pid/vid. These capabilities are sent in an event sequence after the
      zwp_tablet_seat_v2.tablet_added event. This initial event sequence is

      A pad group describes a distinct (sub)set of buttons, rings and strips

      eg. if a tablet has buttons on the left and right side, 2 groups will be

      change on the fly.

      Pad groups will announce their features during pad initialization. Between

      pad group will announce the buttons, rings and strips contained in it,
      plus the number of supported modes.

      Modes are a mechanism to allow multiple groups of actions for every element
      in the pad group. The number of groups and available modes in each is
      persistent across device plugs. The current mode is user-switchable, it
      will be announced through the zwp_tablet_pad_group_v2.mode_switch event both

      The current mode logically applies to all elements in the pad group,

	indices start at 0.

	Switching modes is compositor-dependent. The compositor may provide

      A pad device is a set of buttons, rings, strips and dials
      usually physically present on the tablet device itself. Some
      exceptions exist where the pad device is physically detached, e.g. the
      Wacom ExpressKey Remote.

      Pad devices have no axes that control the cursor and are generally
      auxiliary devices to the tool devices used on the tablet surface.

      A pad device has a number of static characteristics, e.g. the number
      of rings. These capabilities are sent in an event sequence after the
      zwp_tablet_seat_v2.pad_added event before any actual events from this pad.
      This initial event sequence is terminated by a zwp_tablet_pad_v2.done
      event.

      All pad features (buttons, rings, strips and dials) are logically divided into
      groups and all pads have at least one group. The available groups are
      notified through the zwp_tablet_pad_v2.group event; the compositor will
      emit one event per group before emitting zwp_tablet_pad_v2.done.

      Groups may have multiple modes. Modes allow clients to map multiple
      actions to a single pad feature. Only one mode can be active per group,

    <request name="set_feedback">
      <description summary="set compositor feedback">
	Requests the compositor to use the provided feedback string
	associated with this dial. This request should be issued immediately
	after a zwp_tablet_pad_group_v2.mode_switch event from the corresponding
	group is received, or whenever the dial is mapped to a different
	action. See zwp_tablet_pad_group_v2.mode_switch for more details.

	Clients are encouraged to provide context-aware descriptions for
	the actions associated with the dial, and compositors may use this
	information to offer visual feedback about the button layout
	(eg. on-screen displays).

	The provided string 'description' is a UTF-8 encoded string to be
	associated with this ring, and is considered user-visible; general
	internationalization rules apply.

	The serial argument will be that of the last
	zwp_tablet_pad_group_v2.mode_switch event received for the group of this
	dial. Requests providing other serials than the most recent one will be
	ignored.

	Sent whenever the position on a dial changes.

	This event carries the wheel delta as multiples or fractions

	For example, an axis_value120 of 30 is one quarter of
	a logical wheel step in the positive direction, a value120 of
	-240 are two logical wheel steps in the negative direction within the
	same hardware event. See the wl_pointer.axis_value120 for more details.

	The value120 must not be zero.

    <event name="frame">
      <description summary="end of a dial event sequence">
	Indicates the end of a set of events that represent one logical
	hardware dial event. A client is expected to accumulate the data
	in all events within the frame before proceeding.

	All zwp_tablet_pad_dial_v2 events before a zwp_tablet_pad_dial_v2.frame event belong
	logically together.

	A zwp_tablet_pad_dial_v2.frame event is sent for every logical event
	group, even if the group only contains a single zwp_tablet_pad_dial_v2
	event. Specifically, a client may get a sequence: delta, frame,
	delta, frame, etc.
