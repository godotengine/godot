-- This header is automatically generated by the same tool that creates
-- the Binary Section of the SPIR-V specification.

-- Enumeration tokens for SPIR-V, in various styles:
--   C, C++, C++11, JSON, Lua, Python, C#, D
-- 
-- - C will have tokens with a "Spv" prefix, e.g.: SpvSourceLanguageGLSL
-- - C++ will have tokens in the "spv" name space, e.g.: spv::SourceLanguageGLSL
-- - C++11 will use enum classes in the spv namespace, e.g.: spv::SourceLanguage::GLSL
-- - Lua will use tables, e.g.: spv.SourceLanguage.GLSL
-- - Python will use dictionaries, e.g.: spv['SourceLanguage']['GLSL']
-- - C# will use enum classes in the Specification class located in the "Spv" namespace,
--     e.g.: Spv.Specification.SourceLanguage.GLSL
-- - D will have tokens under the "spv" module, e.g: spv.SourceLanguage.GLSL
-- 
-- Some tokens act like mask values, which can be OR'd together,
-- while others are mutually exclusive.  The mask-like ones have
-- "Mask" in their name, and a parallel enum that has the shift
-- amount (1 << x) for each corresponding enumerant.
