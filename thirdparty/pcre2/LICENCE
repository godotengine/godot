PCRE2 LICENCE
-------------

PCRE2 is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

Release 10 of PCRE2 is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
specified below, with one exemption for certain binary redistributions. The
documentation for PCRE2, supplied in the "doc" directory, is distributed under
the same terms as the software itself. The data in the testdata directory is
not copyrighted and is in the public domain.

The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
included in the distribution is a just-in-time compiler that can be used to
optimize pattern matching. This is an optional feature that can be omitted when
the library is built.

EXEMPTION FOR BINARY LIBRARY-LIKE PACKAGES
------------------------------------------

The second condition in the BSD licence (covering binary redistributions) does
not apply all the way down a chain of software. If binary package A includes
PCRE2, it must respect the condition, but if package B is software that
includes package A, the condition is not imposed on package B unless it uses
PCRE2 independently.
