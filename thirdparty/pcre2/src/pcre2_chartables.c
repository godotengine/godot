/* This file was automatically written by the dftables auxiliary
program. It contains character tables that are used when no external
tables are passed to PCRE2 by the application that calls it. The tables
are used only for characters whose code values are less than 256. */

/*The dftables program (which is distributed with PCRE2) can be used to
build alternative versions of this file. This is necessary if you are
running in an EBCDIC environment, or if you want to default to a different
encoding, for example ISO-8859-1. When dftables is run, it creates these
tables in the current locale. This happens automatically if PCRE2 is
configured with --enable-rebuild-chartables. */

/* The following #include is present because without it gcc 4.x may remove
the array definition from the final binary if PCRE2 is built into a static
library and dead code stripping is activated. This leads to link errors.
Pulling in the header ensures that the array gets flagged as "someone
outside this compilation unit might reference this" and so it will always
be supplied to the linker. */
