/**
 * The notation in these files is abbreviated due to the complexity of the
 * functions involved. The key is that the input manifolds are P and Q, while
 * the output is R, and these letters in both upper and lower case refer to
 * these objects. Operations are based on dimensionality: vert: 0, edge: 1,
 * face: 2, solid: 3. X denotes a winding-number type quantity from the source
 * paper of this algorithm, while S is closely related but includes only the
 * subset of X values which "shadow" (are on the correct side of).
 *
 * Nearly everything here are sparse arrays, where for instance each pair in
 * p2q1 refers to a face index of P interacting with a halfedge index of Q.
 * Adjacent arrays like x21 refer to the values of X corresponding to each
 * sparse index pair.
 *
 * Note many functions are designed to work symmetrically, for instance for both
 * p2q1 and p1q2. Inside of these functions P and Q are marked as though the
 * function is forwards, but it may include a Boolean "reverse" that indicates P
 * and Q have been swapped.
