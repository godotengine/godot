 * You agree to use the SOFTWARE only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this license, and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions.
 *
 * 1. LICENSE. Subject to the terms of this license, NVIDIA grants you a non-exclusive limited license to: (a) install and use the SOFTWARE, and (b) distribute the SOFTWARE subject to the distribution requirements described in this license. NVIDIA reserves all rights, title and interest in and to the SOFTWARE not expressly granted to you under this license.
 *
 * 2. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS. These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise the distribution grant:
 * a.      The terms under which you distribute the SOFTWARE must be consistent with the terms of this license, including (without limitation) terms relating to the license grant and license restrictions and protection of NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights.

 * a.      The SOFTWARE is licensed for you to develop applications only for use in systems with NVIDIA GPUs.
 * b.      You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any portion of the SOFTWARE or copies of the SOFTWARE.
 * c.      You may not modify or create derivative works of any portion of the SOFTWARE.
 * d.      You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any technical measure, encryption, security, digital rights management or authentication mechanism in the SOFTWARE.
 * e.      You may not use the SOFTWARE in any manner that would cause it to become subject to an open source software license. As examples, licenses that require as a condition of use, modification, and/or distribution that the SOFTWARE be (i) disclosed or distributed in source code form; (ii) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or (iii) redistributable at no charge.
 * f.      Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not use the SOFTWARE with any system or application where the use or failure of the system or application can reasonably be expected to threaten or result in personal injury, death, or catastrophic loss. Examples include use in avionics, navigation, military, medical, life support or other life critical applications. NVIDIA does not design, test or manufacture the SOFTWARE for these critical uses and NVIDIA shall not be liable to you or any third party, in whole or in part, for any claims or damages arising from such uses.
 * g.      You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA and its affiliates, and their respective employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees and costs incident to establishing the right of indemnification) arising out of or related to use of the SOFTWARE outside of the scope of this Agreement, or not in compliance with its terms.
 *
 * 4. PRE-RELEASE. SOFTWARE versions identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access or otherwise as pre-release may not be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or different security, privacy, availability, and reliability standards relative to commercial versions of NVIDIA software and materials. You may use a pre-release SOFTWARE version at your own risk, understanding that these versions are not intended for use in production or business-critical systems.
 *
 * 5. OWNERSHIP. The SOFTWARE and the related intellectual property rights therein are and will remain the sole and exclusive property of NVIDIA or its licensors.
