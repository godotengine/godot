// The SPIR-V spec requires code blocks to appear in an order satisfying the
// dominator-tree direction (ie, dominator before the dominated).  This is,
// actually, easy to achieve: any pre-order CFG traversal algorithm will do it.
// Because such algorithms visit a block only after traversing some path to it
// from the root, they necessarily visit the block's idom first.
//
// But not every graph-traversal algorithm outputs blocks in an order that
// appears logical to human readers.  The problem is that unrelated branches may
// be interspersed with each other, and merge blocks may come before some of the
// branches being merged.
//
// A good, human-readable order of blocks may be achieved by performing
// depth-first search but delaying merge nodes until after all their branches
// have been visited.  This is implemented below by the inReadableOrder()
// function.
