 * buffer in order for the decode call to complete. The callback must
 * allocate at least min_size in bytes and assign it to fb->data. The callback
 * must zero out all the data allocated. Then the callback must set fb->size
 * to the allocated size. The application does not need to align the allocated
 * data. The callback is triggered when the decoder needs a frame buffer to
 * decode a compressed image into. This function may be called more than once
 * for every call to vpx_codec_decode. The application may set fb->priv to
 * some data which will be passed back in the ximage and the release function
 * call. |fb| is guaranteed to not be NULL. On success the callback must
 * return 0. Any failure the callback must return a value less than 0.
