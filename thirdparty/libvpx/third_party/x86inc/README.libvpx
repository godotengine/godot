Description:
x264/libav's framework for x86 assembly. Contains a variety of macros and
defines that help automatically allow assembly to work cross-platform.

Local Modifications:
Get configuration from vpx_config.asm.
Prefix functions with vpx by default.
Manage name mangling (prefixing with '_') manually because 'PREFIX' does not
  exist in libvpx.
Expand PIC default to macho64 and respect CONFIG_PIC from libvpx
Set 'private_extern' visibility for macho targets.
Copy PIC 'GLOBAL' macros from x86_abi_support.asm
Use .text instead of .rodata on macho to avoid broken tables in PIC mode.
Use .text with no alignment for aout
Only use 'hidden' visibility with Chromium
