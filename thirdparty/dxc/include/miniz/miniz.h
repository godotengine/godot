/* miniz.c 2.1.0 - public domain deflate/inflate, zlib-subset, ZIP reading/writing/appending, PNG writing
   See "unlicense" statement at the end of this file.
   Rich Geldreich <richgel99@gmail.com>, last updated Oct. 13, 2013
   Implements RFC 1950: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1950.txt and RFC 1951: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt

   Most API's defined in miniz.c are optional. For example, to disable the archive related functions just define
   MINIZ_NO_ARCHIVE_APIS, or to get rid of all stdio usage define MINIZ_NO_STDIO (see the list below for more macros).

   * Low-level Deflate/Inflate implementation notes:

     Compression: Use the "tdefl" API's. The compressor supports raw, static, and dynamic blocks, lazy or
     greedy parsing, match length filtering, RLE-only, and Huffman-only streams. It performs and compresses
     approximately as well as zlib.

     Decompression: Use the "tinfl" API's. The entire decompressor is implemented as a single function
     coroutine: see tinfl_decompress(). It supports decompression into a 32KB (or larger power of 2) wrapping buffer, or into a memory
     block large enough to hold the entire file.

     The low-level tdefl/tinfl API's do not make any use of dynamic memory allocation.

   * zlib-style API notes:

     miniz.c implements a fairly large subset of zlib. There's enough functionality present for it to be a drop-in
     zlib replacement in many apps:
        The z_stream struct, optional memory allocation callbacks
        deflateInit/deflateInit2/deflate/deflateReset/deflateEnd/deflateBound
        inflateInit/inflateInit2/inflate/inflateReset/inflateEnd
        compress, compress2, compressBound, uncompress
        CRC-32, Adler-32 - Using modern, minimal code size, CPU cache friendly routines.
        Supports raw deflate streams or standard zlib streams with adler-32 checking.

     Limitations:
      The callback API's are not implemented yet. No support for gzip headers or zlib static dictionaries.
      I've tried to closely emulate zlib's various flavors of stream flushing and return status codes, but
      there are no guarantees that miniz.c pulls this off perfectly.

   * PNG writing: See the tdefl_write_image_to_png_file_in_memory() function, originally written by
     Alex Evans. Supports 1-4 bytes/pixel images.

   * ZIP archive API notes:

     The ZIP archive API's where designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, with just enough abstraction to
     get the job done with minimal fuss. There are simple API's to retrieve file information, read files from
     existing archives, create new archives, append new files to existing archives, or clone archive data from
     one archive to another. It supports archives located in memory or the heap, on disk (using stdio.h),
     or you can specify custom file read/write callbacks.

     - Archive reading: Just call this function to read a single file from a disk archive:

      void *mz_zip_extract_archive_file_to_heap(const char *pZip_filename, const char *pArchive_name,
        size_t *pSize, mz_uint zip_flags);

     For more complex cases, use the "mz_zip_reader" functions. Upon opening an archive, the entire central
     directory is located and read as-is into memory, and subsequent file access only occurs when reading individual files.

     - Archives file scanning: The simple way is to use this function to scan a loaded archive for a specific file:

     int mz_zip_reader_locate_file(mz_zip_archive *pZip, const char *pName, const char *pComment, mz_uint flags);

     The locate operation can optionally check file comments too, which (as one example) can be used to identify
     multiple versions of the same file in an archive. This function uses a simple linear search through the central
     directory, so it's not very fast.

     Alternately, you can iterate through all the files in an archive (using mz_zip_reader_get_num_files()) and
     retrieve detailed info on each file by calling mz_zip_reader_file_stat().

     - Archive creation: Use the "mz_zip_writer" functions. The ZIP writer immediately writes compressed file data
     to disk and builds an exact image of the central directory in memory. The central directory image is written
     all at once at the end of the archive file when the archive is finalized.

     The archive writer can optionally align each file's local header and file data to any power of 2 alignment,
     which can be useful when the archive will be read from optical media. Also, the writer supports placing
     arbitrary data blobs at the very beginning of ZIP archives. Archives written using either feature are still
     readable by any ZIP tool.

     - Archive appending: The simple way to add a single file to an archive is to call this function:

      mz_bool mz_zip_add_mem_to_archive_file_in_place(const char *pZip_filename, const char *pArchive_name,
        const void *pBuf, size_t buf_size, const void *pComment, mz_uint16 comment_size, mz_uint level_and_flags);

     The archive will be created if it doesn't already exist, otherwise it'll be appended to.
     Note the appending is done in-place and is not an atomic operation, so if something goes wrong
     during the operation it's possible the archive could be left without a central directory (although the local
     file headers and file data will be fine, so the archive will be recoverable).

     For more complex archive modification scenarios:
     1. The safest way is to use a mz_zip_reader to read the existing archive, cloning only those bits you want to
     preserve into a new archive using using the mz_zip_writer_add_from_zip_reader() function (which compiles the
     compressed file data as-is). When you're done, delete the old archive and rename the newly written archive, and
     you're done. This is safe but requires a bunch of temporary disk space or heap memory.

     2. Or, you can convert an mz_zip_reader in-place to an mz_zip_writer using mz_zip_writer_init_from_reader(),
     append new files as needed, then finalize the archive which will write an updated central directory to the
     original archive. (This is basically what mz_zip_add_mem_to_archive_file_in_place() does.) There's a
     possibility that the archive's central directory could be lost with this method if anything goes wrong, though.

     - ZIP archive support limitations:
     No zip64 or spanning support. Extraction functions can only handle unencrypted, stored or deflated files.
     Requires streams capable of seeking.

   * This is a header file library, like stb_image.c. To get only a header file, either cut and paste the
     below header, or create miniz.h, #define MINIZ_HEADER_FILE_ONLY, and then include miniz.c from it.

   * Important: For best perf. be sure to customize the below macros for your target platform:
     #define MINIZ_USE_UNALIGNED_LOADS_AND_STORES 1
     #define MINIZ_LITTLE_ENDIAN 1
     #define MINIZ_HAS_64BIT_REGISTERS 1

   * On platforms using glibc, Be sure to "#define _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE 1" before including miniz.c to ensure miniz
     uses the 64-bit variants: fopen64(), stat64(), etc. Otherwise you won't be able to process large files
     (i.e. 32-bit stat() fails for me on files > 0x7FFFFFFF bytes).
