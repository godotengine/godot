// The purpose of this file is to glue the mismatching headers (Android NDK vs
// glibc) and therefore avoid doing otherwise awkward #ifdefs in the code.
// The following quirks are currently handled by this file:
// - i386: Use the Android NDK but alias user_fxsr_struct > user_fpxregs_struct.

// TODO(primiano): remove these changes after Chromium has stably rolled to
// an NDK with the appropriate fixes. https://crbug.com/358831

// With traditional headers, <sys/user.h> forgot to do this. Unified headers get
// it right.
