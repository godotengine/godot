/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Conversions between UTF32, UTF-16, and UTF-8.  Header file.

Several funtions are included here, forming a complete set of
conversions between the three formats.  UTF-7 is not included
here, but is handled in a separate source file.

Each of these routines takes pointers to input buffers and output
buffers.  The input buffers are const.

Each routine converts the text between *sourceStart and sourceEnd,
putting the result into the buffer between *targetStart and
targetEnd. Note: the end pointers are *after* the last item: e.g.
*(sourceEnd - 1) is the last item.

The return result indicates whether the conversion was successful,
and if not, whether the problem was in the source or target buffers.
(Only the first encountered problem is indicated.)

After the conversion, *sourceStart and *targetStart are both
updated to point to the end of last text successfully converted in
the respective buffers.

Input parameters:
sourceStart - pointer to a pointer to the source buffer.
The contents of this are modified on return so that
it points at the next thing to be converted.
targetStart - similarly, pointer to pointer to the target buffer.
sourceEnd, targetEnd - respectively pointers to the ends of the
two buffers, for overflow checking only.

These conversion functions take a ConversionFlags argument. When this
flag is set to strict, both irregular sequences and isolated surrogates
will cause an error.  When the flag is set to lenient, both irregular
sequences and isolated surrogates are converted.

Whether the flag is strict or lenient, all illegal sequences will cause
an error return. This includes sequences such as: <F4 90 80 80>, <C0 80>,
or <A0> in UTF-8, and values above 0x10FFFF in UTF-32. Conformant code
must check for illegal sequences.

When the flag is set to lenient, characters over 0x10FFFF are converted
to the replacement character; otherwise (when the flag is set to strict)
they constitute an error.

Output parameters:
The value "sourceIllegal" is returned from some routines if the input
sequence is malformed.  When "sourceIllegal" is returned, the source
value will point to the illegal value that caused the problem. E.g.,
in UTF-8 when a sequence is malformed, it points to the start of the
malformed sequence.
