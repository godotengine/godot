// |buffer_size| specifies the size of |buffer| in bytes. As this function
// always NULL-terminates |buffer| on success, |buffer_size| should be
// at least one byte longer than the expected path length (e.g. PATH_MAX,
// which is typically defined as the maximum length of a path name
// including the NULL byte).

// The implementation of this function calls sys_readlink() instead of
// readlink(), it can thus be used in the context where calling to libc
// functions is discouraged.
