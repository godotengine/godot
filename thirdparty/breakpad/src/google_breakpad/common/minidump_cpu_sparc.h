/* minidump_format.h: A cross-platform reimplementation of minidump-related
 * portions of DbgHelp.h from the Windows Platform SDK.
 *
 * (This is C99 source, please don't corrupt it with C++.)
 *
 * This file contains the necessary definitions to read minidump files
 * produced on sparc.  These files may be read on any platform provided
 * that the alignments of these structures on the processing system are
 * identical to the alignments of these structures on the producing system.
 * For this reason, precise-sized types are used.  The structures defined
 * by this file have been laid out to minimize alignment problems by ensuring
 * ensuring that all members are aligned on their natural boundaries.  In
 * In some cases, tail-padding may be significant when different ABIs specify
 * different tail-padding behaviors.  To avoid problems when reading or
 * writing affected structures, MD_*_SIZE macros are provided where needed,
 * containing the useful size of the structures without padding.
 *
 * Structures that are defined by Microsoft to contain a zero-length array
 * are instead defined here to contain an array with one element, as
 * zero-length arrays are forbidden by standard C and C++.  In these cases,
 * *_minsize constants are provided to be used in place of sizeof.  For a
 * cleaner interface to these sizes when using C++, see minidump_size.h.
 *
 * These structures are also sufficient to populate minidump files.
 *
 * These definitions may be extended to support handling minidump files
 * for other CPUs and other operating systems.
 *
 * Because precise data type sizes are crucial for this implementation to
 * function properly and portably in terms of interoperability with minidumps
 * produced by DbgHelp on Windows, a set of primitive types with known sizes
 * are used as the basis of each structure defined by this file.  DbgHelp
 * on Windows is assumed to be the reference implementation; this file
 * seeks to provide a cross-platform compatible implementation.  To avoid
 * collisions with the types and values defined and used by DbgHelp in the
 * event that this implementation is used on Windows, each type and value
 * defined here is given a new name, beginning with "MD".  Names of the
 * equivalent types and values in the Windows Platform SDK are given in
 * comments.
