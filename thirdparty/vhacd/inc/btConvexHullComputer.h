		between the addresses of consecutive vertices. If "shrink" is positive, the convex hull is shrunken
		by that amount (each face is moved by "shrink" length units towards the center along its normal).
		If "shrinkClamp" is positive, "shrink" is clamped to not exceed "shrinkClamp * innerRadius", where "innerRadius"
		is the minimum distance of a face to the center of the convex hull.

		The returned value is the amount by which the hull has been shrunken. If it is negative, the amount was so large
		that the resulting convex hull is empty.

		The output convex hull can be found in the member variables "vertices", "edges", "faces".
