/* The type of the error callback argument to backtrace functions.
   This function, if not NULL, will be called for certain error cases.
   The DATA argument is passed to the function that calls this one.
   The MSG argument is an error message.  The ERRNUM argument, if
   greater than 0, holds an errno value.  The MSG buffer may become
   invalid after this function returns.

   As a special case, the ERRNUM argument will be passed as -1 if no
   debug info can be found for the executable, or if the debug info
   exists but has an unsupported version, but the function requires
   debug info (e.g., backtrace_full, backtrace_pcinfo).  The MSG in
   this case will be something along the lines of "no debug info".
   Similarly, ERRNUM will be passed as -1 if there is no symbol table,
   but the function requires a symbol table (e.g., backtrace_syminfo).
   This may be used as a signal that some other approach should be
   tried.  */

   called before any of the other routines, and its return value must
   be passed to all of the other routines.  FILENAME is the path name
   of the executable file; if it is NULL the library will try
   system-specific path names.  If not NULL, FILENAME must point to a
   permanent buffer.  If THREADED is non-zero the state may be
   accessed by multiple threads simultaneously, and the library will
   use appropriate atomic operations.  If THREADED is zero the state
   may only be accessed by one thread at a time.  This returns a state
   pointer on success, NULL on error.  If an error occurs, this will
   call the ERROR_CALLBACK routine.

   Calling this function allocates resources that cannot be freed.
   There is no backtrace_free_state function.  The state is used to
   cache information that is expensive to recompute.  Programs are
   expected to call this function at most once and to save the return
   value for all later calls to backtrace functions.  */
