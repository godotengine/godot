/**
 * hb_glyph_flags_t:
 * @HB_GLYPH_FLAG_UNSAFE_TO_BREAK: Indicates that if input text is broken at the
 * 				   beginning of the cluster this glyph is part of,
 * 				   then both sides need to be re-shaped, as the
 * 				   result might be different.
 * 				   On the flip side, it means that when this
 * 				   flag is not present, then it is safe to break
 * 				   the glyph-run at the beginning of this
 * 				   cluster, and the two sides will represent the
 * 				   exact same result one would get if breaking
 * 				   input text at the beginning of this cluster
 * 				   and shaping the two sides separately.
 * 				   This can be used to optimize paragraph
 * 				   layout, by avoiding re-shaping of each line
 * 				   after line-breaking.
 * @HB_GLYPH_FLAG_UNSAFE_TO_CONCAT: Indicates that if input text is changed on one
 * 				   side of the beginning of the cluster this glyph
 * 				   is part of, then the shaping results for the
 * 				   other side might change.
 * 				   Note that the absence of this flag will NOT by
 * 				   itself mean that it IS safe to concat text.
 * 				   Only two pieces of text both of which clear of
 * 				   this flag can be concatenated safely.
 * 				   This can be used to optimize paragraph
 * 				   layout, by avoiding re-shaping of each line
 * 				   after line-breaking, by limiting the
 * 				   reshaping to a small piece around the
 * 				   breaking position only, even if the breaking
 * 				   position carries the
 * 				   #HB_GLYPH_FLAG_UNSAFE_TO_BREAK or when
 * 				   hyphenation or other text transformation
 * 				   happens at line-break position, in the following
 * 				   way:
 * 				   1. Iterate back from the line-break position
 * 				   until the first cluster start position that is
 * 				   NOT unsafe-to-concat, 2. shape the segment from
 * 				   there till the end of line, 3. check whether the
 * 				   resulting glyph-run also is clear of the
 * 				   unsafe-to-concat at its start-of-text position;
 * 				   if it is, just splice it into place and the line
 * 				   is shaped; If not, move on to a position further
 * 				   back that is clear of unsafe-to-concat and retry
 * 				   from there, and repeat.
 * 				   At the start of next line a similar algorithm can
 * 				   be implemented. That is: 1. Iterate forward from
 * 				   the line-break position until the first cluster
 * 				   start position that is NOT unsafe-to-concat, 2.
 * 				   shape the segment from beginning of the line to
 * 				   that position, 3. check whether the resulting
 * 				   glyph-run also is clear of the unsafe-to-concat
 * 				   at its end-of-text position; if it is, just splice
 * 				   it into place and the beginning is shaped; If not,
 * 				   move on to a position further forward that is clear
 * 				   of unsafe-to-concat and retry up to there, and repeat.
 * 				   A slight complication will arise in the
 * 				   implementation of the algorithm above,
 * 				   because while our buffer API has a way to
 * 				   return flags for position corresponding to
 * 				   start-of-text, there is currently no position
 * 				   corresponding to end-of-text.  This limitation
 * 				   can be alleviated by shaping more text than needed
 * 				   and looking for unsafe-to-concat flag within text
 * 				   clusters.
 * 				   The #HB_GLYPH_FLAG_UNSAFE_TO_BREAK flag will
 * 				   always imply this flag.
 *				   To use this flag, you must enable the buffer flag
 *				   @HB_BUFFER_FLAG_PRODUCE_UNSAFE_TO_CONCAT during
 *				   shaping, otherwise the buffer flag will not be
 *				   reliably produced.
 * 				   Since: 4.0.0
 * @HB_GLYPH_FLAG_SAFE_TO_INSERT_TATWEEL: In scripts that use elongation (Arabic,
				   Mongolian, Syriac, etc.), this flag signifies
				   that it is safe to insert a U+0640 TATWEEL
				   character before this cluster for elongation.
				   This flag does not determine the
				   script-specific elongation places, but only
				   when it is safe to do the elongation without
				   interrupting text shaping.
				   Since: 5.1.0
 * @HB_GLYPH_FLAG_DEFINED: All the currently defined flags.
 *
