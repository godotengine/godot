/**
 * hb_subset_repack_or_fail:
 * @table_tag: tag of the table being packed, needed to allow table specific optimizations.
 * @hb_objects: raw array of struct hb_object_t, which provides
 * object graph info
 * @num_hb_objs: number of hb_object_t in the hb_objects array.
 *
 * Given the input object graph info, repack a table to eliminate
 * offset overflows. A nullptr is returned if the repacking attempt fails.
 * Table specific optimizations (eg. extension promotion in GSUB/GPOS) may be performed.
