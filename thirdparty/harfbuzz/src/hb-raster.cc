/**

 * @short_description: Glyph rasterization
 * @include: hb-raster.h
 *
 * Functions for rasterizing glyph outlines into pixel buffers.
 *
 * #hb_raster_draw_t rasterizes outline geometry and always outputs
 * @HB_RASTER_FORMAT_A8. Typical flow:
 * ```
 * hb_raster_draw_t *draw = hb_raster_draw_create_or_fail ();
 * hb_raster_draw_set_scale_factor (draw, 64.f, 64.f);
 * hb_raster_draw_set_transform (draw, 1.f, 0.f, 0.f, 1.f, 0.f, 0.f);
 * hb_raster_draw_set_glyph_extents (draw, &glyph_extents);
 * hb_raster_draw_glyph (draw, font, gid, pen_x, pen_y);
 * hb_raster_image_t *mask = hb_raster_draw_render (draw);
 * ```
 *
 * #hb_raster_paint_t renders color paint graphs and always outputs
 * @HB_RASTER_FORMAT_BGRA32. Typical flow:
 * ```
 * hb_raster_paint_t *paint = hb_raster_paint_create_or_fail ();
 * hb_raster_paint_set_scale_factor (paint, 64.f, 64.f);
 * hb_raster_paint_set_transform (paint, 1.f, 0.f, 0.f, 1.f, 0.f, 0.f);
 * hb_raster_paint_set_foreground (paint, foreground);
 * hb_glyph_extents_t glyph_extents;
 * hb_font_get_glyph_extents (font, gid, &glyph_extents);
 * hb_raster_paint_set_glyph_extents (paint, &glyph_extents);
 * hb_raster_paint_glyph (paint, font, gid, pen_x, pen_y, 0, foreground);
 * hb_raster_image_t *img = hb_raster_paint_render (paint);
 * ```
 *
 * In both modes, set extents explicitly (or via glyph extents) before
 * rendering to avoid implicit allocations and to get deterministic bounds.
