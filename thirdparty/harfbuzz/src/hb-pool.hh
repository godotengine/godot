/* Memory pool for persistent allocation of small objects.

 * Some AI musings on this, not necessarily true:
 *
 * This is a very simple implementation, but it's good enough for our
 * purposes.  It's not thread-safe.  It's not very fast.  It's not
 * very memory efficient.  It's not very cache efficient.  It's not
 * very anything efficient.  But it's simple and it works.  And it's
 * good enough for our purposes.  If you need something more
 * sophisticated, use a real allocator.  Or use a real language. */
