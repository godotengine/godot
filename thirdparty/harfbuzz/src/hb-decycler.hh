/*
 * hb_decycler_t is an efficient cycle detector for graph traversal.
 * It's a simple tortoise-and-hare algorithm with a twist: it's
 * designed to detect cycles while traversing a graph in a DFS manner,
 * instead of just a linked list.
 *
 * For Floyd's tortoise and hare algorithm, see:
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Floyd's_tortoise_and_hare
 *
 * hb_decycler_t is O(n) in the number of nodes in the DFS traversal
 * if there are no cycles. Unlike Floyd's algorithm, hb_decycler_t
 * can be used in a DFS traversal, where the graph is not a simple
 * linked list, but a tree with possible cycles.  Like Floyd's algorithm,
 * it is constant-memory (~three  pointers).
 *
 * The decycler works by creating an implicit linked-list on the stack,
 * of the path from the root to the current node, and apply Floyd's
 * algorithm on that list as it goes.
 *
 * The decycler is malloc-free, and as such, much faster to use than a
 * hb_set_t or hb_map_t equivalent.
 *
 * The decycler detects cycles in the graph *eventually*, not *immediately*.
 * That is, it may not detect a cycle until the cycle is fully traversed,
 * even multiple times. See Floyd's algorithm analysis for details.
 *
 * The implementation saves a pointer storage on the stack by combining
 * this->u.decycler and this->u.next into a union.  This is possible because
 * at any point we only need one of those values. The invariant is that
 * after construction, and before destruction, of a node, the u.decycler
 * field is always valid. The u.next field is only valid when the node is
 * in the traversal path, parent to another node.
 *
 * There are three method's:
 *
 *   - hb_decycler_node_t() constructor: Creates a new node in the traversal.
 *     The constructor takes a reference to the decycler object and inserts
 *     itself as the latest node in the traversal path, by advancing the hare
 *     pointer, and for every other descent, advancing the tortoise pointer.
 *
 *   - ~hb_decycler_node_t() destructor: Restores the decycler object to its
 *      previous state by removing the node from the traversal path.
 *
 *   - bool visit(uintptr_t value): Called on every node in the graph.  Returns
 *     true if the node is not part of a cycle, and false if it is.  The value
 *     parameter is used to detect cycles.  It's the caller's responsibility
 *     to ensure that the value is unique for each node in the graph.
 *     The cycle detection is as simple as comparing the value to the value
 *     held by the tortoise pointer, which is the Floyd's algorithm.
 *
 * For usage examples see test-decycler.cc.
