/**

 * @short_description: Object representing a shaping plan
 * @include: hb.h
 *
 * Shape plans are an internal mechanism. Each plan contains state
 * describing how HarfBuzz will shape a particular text segment, based on
 * the combination of segment properties and the capabilities in the
 * font face in use.
 *
 * Shape plans are not used for shaping directly, but can be queried to
 * access certain information about how shaping will perform, given a set
 * of specific input parameters (script, language, direction, features,
 * etc.).
 *
 * Most client programs will not need to deal with shape plans directly.
