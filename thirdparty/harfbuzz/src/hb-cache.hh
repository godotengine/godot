/* Implements a lockfree cache for int->int functions.
 *
 * The cache is a fixed-size array of 16-bit or 32-bit integers.
 * The key is split into two parts: the cache index and the rest.
 *
 * The cache index is used to index into the array.  The rest is used
 * to store the key and the value.
 *
 * The value is stored in the least significant bits of the integer.
 * The key is stored in the most significant bits of the integer.
 * The key is shifted by cache_bits to the left to make room for the
 * value.
