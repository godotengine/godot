/* Implements a lockfree and thread-safe cache for int->int functions,
 * using (optionally) _relaxed_ atomic integer operations.
 *
 * The cache is a fixed-size array of 16-bit or 32-bit integers,
 * typically 256 elements.
 *
 * The key is split into two parts: the cache index (high bits)
 * and the rest (low bits).
 *
 * The cache index is used to index into the array.  The array
 * member is a 16-bit or 32-bit integer that is used *both*
 * to store the low bits of the key, and the value.
 *
 * The value is stored in the least significant bits of the integer.
 * The low bits of the key are stored in the most significant bits
 * of the integer.
 *
 * A cache hit is detected by comparing the low bits of the key
 * with the high bits of the integer at the array position indexed
 * by the high bits of the key. If they match, the value is extracted
 * from the least significant bits of the integer and returned.
 * Otherwise, a cache miss is reported.
 *
 * Cache operations (storage and retrieval) involve just a few
 * arithmetic operations and a single memory access.
