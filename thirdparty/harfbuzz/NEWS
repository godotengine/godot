- hb-ft now locks underlying FT_Face during use.

API changes:

- Newly-created hb_font_t's now have our internal "hb-ot-font"
  callbacks set on them, so they should work out of the box
  without any callbacks set.  If callbacks are set, everything
  is back to what it was before, the fallback callbacks are
  null.  If you to get the internal implementation modified,
  sub_font it.

- New hb_font_funcs_set_nominal_glyphs_func() allows speeding
  up character to glyph mapping.

  The following functions do NOT reference their return value before
  returning:
  * hb_unicode_funcs_get_default()
  * hb_glib_get_unicode_funcs()
  * hb_icu_get_unicode_funcs()
  This is consistent with their naming ("get", instead of "reference")
  as well as how they are used in the wild (ie. no one calls destroy()
  on their return value.)

Overview of changes leading to 1.5.1
Tuesday, September 5, 2017
====================================

- Fix "unsafe-to-break" in fallback shaping and other corner cases.
  All our tests pass with --verify now, meaning unsafe-to-break API
  works as expected.
- Add --unicodes to hb-view / hb-shape.
- [indic] Treat Consonant_With_Stacker as consonant.  This will need
  further tweaking.
- hb_buffer_diff() tweaks.


Overview of changes leading to 1.5.0
Wednesday, August 23, 2017
====================================

- Misc new API, for appending a buffer to another, and for comparing
  contents of two buffers for types of differences.

- New "unsafe-to-break" API.  Can be used to speed up reshaping
  in line-breaking situations.  Essentially, after shaping, it returns
  positions in the input string (some of the cluster boundaries) that
  are "safe to break" in that if the text is segmented at that position
  and two sides reshaped and concatenated, the shaping result is
  exactly the same as shaping the text in one piece.

  hb-view and hb-shape and hb-shape now take --verify, which verifies
  the above property.

  Some corner cases of the implementation are still not quite working.
  Those will be fixed in subsequent releases.

- New API:

hb_buffer_append()

hb_glyph_flags_t
HB_GLYPH_FLAG_UNSAFE_TO_BREAK
HB_GLYPH_FLAG_DEFINED
hb_glyph_info_get_glyph_flags()

HB_BUFFER_SERIALIZE_FLAG_GLYPH_FLAGS

hb_buffer_diff_flags_t
HB_BUFFER_DIFF_FLAG_EQUAL
HB_BUFFER_DIFF_FLAG_CONTENT_TYPE_MISMATCH
HB_BUFFER_DIFF_FLAG_LENGTH_MISMATCH
HB_BUFFER_DIFF_FLAG_NOTDEF_PRESENT
HB_BUFFER_DIFF_FLAG_DOTTED_CIRCLE_PRESENT
HB_BUFFER_DIFF_FLAG_CODEPOINT_MISMATCH
HB_BUFFER_DIFF_FLAG_CLUSTER_MISMATCH
HB_BUFFER_DIFF_FLAG_GLYPH_FLAGS_MISMATCH
HB_BUFFER_DIFF_FLAG_POSITION_MISMATCH
hb_buffer_diff

- Fix buffer-overrun in Bengali.


Overview of changes leading to 1.4.3
Saturday, February 25, 2017
====================================

- Route Adlam script to Arabic shaper.
- Misc fixes.
- New API:
  hb_font_set_face()
- Deprecate API:
  hb_graphite2_font_get_gr_font()


Overview of changes leading to 1.4.2
Monday, January 23, 2017
====================================

- Implement OpenType Font Variation tables avar/fvar/HVAR/VVAR.
- hb-shape and hb-view now accept --variations.
- New API:

hb_variation_t
hb_variation_from_string()
hb_variation_to_string()

hb_font_set_variations()
hb_font_set_var_coords_design()
hb_font_get_var_coords_normalized()

hb-ot-var.h:
hb_ot_var_axis_t
hb_ot_var_has_data()
hb_ot_var_get_axis_count()
hb_ot_var_get_axes()
hb_ot_var_find_axis()
hb_ot_var_normalize_variations()
hb_ot_var_normalize_coords()

- MVAR to be implemented later.  Access to named instances to be
  implemented later as well.

- Misc fixes.


Overview of changes leading to 1.4.1
Thursday, January 5, 2017
====================================

- Always build and use UCDN for Unicode data by default.
  Reduces dependence on version of Unicode data in glib,
  specially in the Windows bundles we are shipping, which
  have very old glib.


Overview of changes leading to 1.4.0
Thursday, January 5, 2017
====================================

- Merged "OpenType GX" branch which adds core of support for
  OpenType 1.8 Font Variations.  To that extent, the relevant
  new API is:

New API:
hb_font_set_var_coords_normalized()

  with supporting API:

New API:
HB_OT_LAYOUT_NO_VARIATIONS_INDEX
hb_ot_layout_table_find_feature_variations()
hb_ot_layout_feature_with_variations_get_lookups()
hb_shape_plan_create2()
hb_shape_plan_create_cached2()

  Currently variations in GSUB/GPOS/GDEF are fully supported,
  and no other tables are supported.  In particular, fvar/avar
  are NOT supported, hence the hb_font_set_var_coords_normalized()
  taking normalized coordinates.  API to take design coordinates
  will be added in the future.

  HVAR/VVAR/MVAR support will also be added to hb-ot-font in the
  future.

- Fix regression in GDEF glyph class processing.
- Add decompositions for Chakma, Limbu, and Balinese in USE shaper.
- Misc fixes.

Overview of changes leading to 1.3.2
Wednesday, September 27, 2016
====================================

- Fix build of hb-coretext on older OS X versions.


Overview of changes leading to 1.3.1
Wednesday, September 7, 2016
====================================

- Blacklist bad GDEF of more fonts (Padauk).
- More CoreText backend crash fixes with OS X 10.9.5.
- Misc fixes.


Overview of changes leading to 1.3.0
Thursday, July 21, 2016
====================================

- Update to Unicode 9.0.0
- Move Javanese from Indic shaper to Universal Shaping Engine.
- Allow MultipleSubst to delete a glyph (matching Windows engine).
- Update Universal Shaping Engine to latest draft from Microsoft.
- DirectWrite backend improvements.  Note: this backend is for testing ONLY.
- CoreText backend improvements with unreachable fonts.
- Implement symbol fonts (cmap 3.0.0) in hb-ft and hb-ot-font.
- Blacklist bad GDEF of more fonts (Tahoma & others).
- Misc fixes.


Overview of changes leading to 1.2.7
Monday, May 2, 2016
====================================

- Blacklist another version of Times New Roman (Bold) Italic from Windows 7.
- Fix Mongolian Free Variation Selectors shaping with certain fonts.
- Fix Tibetan shorthand contractions shaping.
- Improved list of language tag mappings.
- Unbreak build on Windows CE.

Overview of changes leading to 1.2.6
Friday, April 8, 2016
====================================

- Blacklist GDEF table of another set of Times New Roman (Bold) Italic.
- DirectWrite backend improvements.  Note: DirectWrite backend is
  exclusively for our internal testing and should NOT be used in any
  production system whatsoever.


Overview of changes leading to 1.2.5
Monday, April 4, 2016
====================================

- Fix GDEF mark-filtering-set, which was broken in 1.2.3.


Overview of changes leading to 1.2.4
Thursday, March 17, 2016
====================================

- Synthesize GDEF glyph class for any glyph that does not have one in GDEF.
  I really hope we don't discover broken fonts that shape badly with this
  change.
- Misc build and other minor fixes.
- API changes:
  - Added HB_NDEBUG.  It's fine for production systems to define this to
    disable high-overhead debugging checks.  However, I also reduced the
    overhead of those checks, so it's a non-issue right now.  You can
    forget it.  Just not defining anything at all is fine.


Overview of changes leading to 1.2.3
Thursday, February 25, 2016
====================================

- Blacklist GDEF table of certain versions of Times New Roman (Bold) Italic,
  due to bug in glyph class of ASCII double-quote character.  This should
  address "regression" introduced in 1.2.0 when we switched mark zeroing
  in most shapers from BY_UNICODE_LATE to BY_GDEF_LATE.
  This fourth release in a week should finally stablize things...

- hb-ot-font's get_glyph() implementation saw some optimizations.  Though,
  might be really hard to measure in real-world situations.

- Also, two rather small API changes:

We now disable some time-consuming internal bookkeeping if built with NDEBUG
defined.  This is a first time that we use NDEBUG to disable debug code.  If
there exist production systems that do NOT want to enable NDEBUG, please let
me know and I'll add HB_NDEBUG.

Added get_nominal_glyph() and get_variation_glyph() instead of get_glyph()

New API:
- hb_font_get_nominal_glyph_func_t
- hb_font_get_variation_glyph_func_t
- hb_font_funcs_set_nominal_glyph_func()
- hb_font_funcs_set_variation_glyph_func()
- hb_font_get_nominal_glyph()
- hb_font_get_variation_glyph()

Deprecated API:
- hb_font_get_glyph_func_t
- hb_font_funcs_set_glyph_func()

Clients that implement their own font-funcs are encouraged to replace
their get_glyph() implementation with a get_nominal_glyph() and
get_variation_glyph() pair.  The variation version can assume that
variation_selector argument is not zero.  Old (deprecated) functions
will continue working indefinitely using internal gymnastics; it is
just more efficient to use the new functions.


Overview of changes leading to 1.2.2
Wednesday, February 24, 2016
====================================

- Fix regression with mark positioning with fonts that have
  non-zero mark advances.  This was introduced in 1.2.0 while
  trying to make mark and cursive attachments to work together.
  I have partially reverted that, so this version is much more
  like what we had before.  All clients who updated to 1.2.0
  should update to this version.


Overview of changes leading to 1.2.1
Tuesday, February 23, 2016
====================================

- CoreText: Fix bug with wrong scale if font scale was changed later.
  https://github.com/libass/libass/issues/212
- CoreText: Drastically speed up font initialization.
- CoreText: Fix tiny leak.

  https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/issues/217
- Add test/shaping/README.md about how to add tests to the suite.


Overview of changes leading to 1.2.0
Friday, February 19, 2016
====================================

- Fix various issues (hangs mostly) in case of memory allocation failure.
- Change mark zeroing types of most shapers from BY_UNICODE_LATE to
  BY_GDEF_LATE.  This seems to be what Uniscribe does.
- Change mark zeroing of USE shaper from NONE to BY_GDEF_EARLY.  That's
  what Windows does.
- Allow GPOS cursive connection on marks, and fix the interaction with
  mark attachment.  This work resulted in some changes to how mark
  attachments work.  See:
  https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/issues/211
  https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/commit/86c68c7a2c971efe8e35b1f1bd99401dc8b688d2
- Graphite2 shaper: improved negative advance handling (eg. Nastaliq).
- Add nmake-based build system for Windows.
- Minor speedup.
- Misc. improvements.


Overview of changes leading to 1.1.3
Monday, January 11, 2016
====================================

- Ported Indic shaper to Unicode 8.0 data.
- Universal Shaping Engine fixes.
- Speed up CoreText shaper when font fallback happens in CoreText.
- Documentation improvements, thanks to Khaled Hosny.
- Very rough directwrite shaper for testing, thanks to Ebrahim Byagowi.
- Misc bug fixes.
- New API:

  * Font extents:
      hb_font_extents_t
      hb_font_get_font_extents_func_t
      hb_font_get_font_h_extents_func_t
      hb_font_get_font_v_extents_func_t
      hb_font_funcs_set_font_h_extents_func
      hb_font_funcs_set_font_v_extents_func
      hb_font_get_h_extents
      hb_font_get_v_extents
      hb_font_get_extents_for_direction

  * Buffer message (aka debug):
      hb_buffer_message_func_t
      hb_buffer_set_message_func()
    Actual message protocol to be fleshed out later.


Overview of changes leading to 1.1.2
Wednesday, November 26, 2015
====================================

- Fix badly-broken fallback shaper that affected terminology.
  https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/issues/187
- Fix y_scaling in Graphite shaper.
- API changes:
  * An unset glyph_h_origin() function in font-funcs now (sensibly)
    implies horizontal origin at 0,0.  Ie, the nil callback returns
    true instead of false.  As such, implementations that have a
    glyph_h_origin() that simply returns true, can remove that function
    with HarfBuzz >= 1.1.2.  This results in a tiny speedup.


Overview of changes leading to 1.1.1
Wednesday, November 24, 2015
====================================

- Build fixes, specially for hb-coretext.


Overview of changes leading to 1.1.0
Wednesday, November 18, 2015
====================================

- Implement 'stch' stretch feature for Syriac Abbreviation Mark.
  https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/issues/141

  if the font does not support them.
  https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/issues/153
- If font does not support U+2011 NO-BREAK HYPHEN, fallback to
  U+2010 HYPHEN.
- Changes resulting from libFuzzer continuous fuzzing:
  * Reject font tables that need more than 8 edits,
  * Bound buffer growth during shaping to 32x,
  * Fix assertions and other issues at OOM / buffer max-growth.
- Misc fixes and optimizations.
- API changes:
  * All fonts created with hb_font_create() now inherit from
    (ie. have parent) hb_font_get_empty().


Overview of changes leading to 1.0.6
Thursday, October 15, 2015
====================================

- Reduce max nesting level in OT lookups from 8 to 6.
  Should not affect any real font as far as I know.
- Fix memory access issue in ot-font.
- Revert default load-flags of fonts created using hb_ft_font_create()
  back to FT_LOAD_DEFAULT|FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING.  This was changed in
  last release (1.0.5), but caused major issues, so revert.
  https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/issues/143


Overview of changes leading to 1.0.5
Tuesday, October 13, 2015
====================================

- Fix multiple memory access bugs discovered using libFuzzer.
  https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/issues/139
  Everyone should upgrade to this version as soon as possible.
  We now have continuous fuzzing set up, to avoid issues like
  these creeping in again.
- Misc fixes.

- New API:
  * hb_font_set_parent().
  * hb_ft_font_[sg]et_load_flags()
    The default flags for fonts created using hb_ft_font_create()
    has changed to default to FT_LOAD_DEFAULT now.  Previously it
    was defaulting to FT_LOAD_DFEAULT|FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING.

- API changes:
  * Fonts now default to units-per-EM as their scale, instead of 0.
  * hb_font_create_sub_font() does NOT make parent font immutable
    anymore.  hb_font_make_immutable() does.


Overview of changes leading to 1.0.4
Wednesday, September 30, 2015

Wednesday, December 17, 2014
=====================================

- Fix out-of-bounds access in Context lookup format 3.
- Indic: Allow ZWJ/ZWNJ before syllable modifiers.


Overview of changes leading to 0.9.36
Thursday, November 20, 2014
=====================================

- First time that three months went by without a release since
  0.9.2 was released on August 10, 2012!
- Fix performance bug in hb_ot_collect_glyphs():
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1090869
- Add basic vertical-text support to hb-ot-font.
- Misc build fixes.


Overview of changes leading to 0.9.35
Saturday, August 13, 2014
=====================================

- Fix major shape-plan caching bug when more than one shaper were
  provided to hb_shape_full() (as exercised by XeTeX).
  http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-bugs-dist@lists.debian.org/msg1246370.html
- Fix Arabic fallback shaping regression.  This was broken in 0.9.32.
- Major hb-coretext fixes.  That backend is complete now, including
  respecing buffer direction and language, down to vertical writing.
- Build fixes for Windows CE.  Should build fine now.
- Misc fixes:
  Use atexit() only if it's safe to call from shared library
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82246
  Mandaic had errors in its Unicode Joining_Type
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82306
- API changes:

  * hb_buffer_clear_contents() does not reset buffer flags now.

    After 763e5466c0a03a7c27020e1e2598e488612529a7, one doesn't
    need to set flags for different pieces of text.  The flags now
    are something the client sets up once, depending on how it
    actually uses the buffer.  As such, don't clear it in
    clear_contents().

    I don't expect any changes to be needed to any existing client.


Overview of changes leading to 0.9.34
Saturday, August 2, 2014
=====================================

- hb_feature_from_string() now accepts CSS font-feature-settings format.
- As a result, hb-shape / hb-view --features also accept CSS-style strings.
  Eg, "'liga' off" is accepted now.
- Add old-spec Myanmar shaper:
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=81775
- Don't apply 'calt' in Hangul shaper.
- Fix mark advance zeroing for Hebrew shaper:
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=76767
- Implement Windows-1256 custom Arabic shaping.  Only built on Windows,
  and requires help from get_glyph().  Used by Firefox.
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1045139
- Disable 'liga' in vertical text.
- Build fixes.
- API changes:

  * Make HB_BUFFER_FLAG_BOT/EOT easier to use.

    Previously, we expected users to provide BOT/EOT flags when the
    text *segment* was at paragraph boundaries.  This meant that for
    clients that provide full paragraph to HarfBuzz (eg. Pango), they
    had code like this:

      hb_buffer_set_flags (hb_buffer,
                           (item_offset == 0 ? HB_BUFFER_FLAG_BOT : 0) |
                           (item_offset + item_length == paragraph_length ?
                            HB_BUFFER_FLAG_EOT : 0));

      hb_buffer_add_utf8 (hb_buffer,
                          paragraph_text, paragraph_length,
                          item_offset, item_length);

    After this change such clients can simply say:

      hb_buffer_set_flags (hb_buffer,
                           HB_BUFFER_FLAG_BOT | HB_BUFFER_FLAG_EOT);

      hb_buffer_add_utf8 (hb_buffer,
                          paragraph_text, paragraph_length,
                          item_offset, item_length);

    Ie, HarfBuzz itself checks whether the segment is at the beginning/end
    of the paragraph.  Clients that only pass item-at-a-time to HarfBuzz
    continue not setting any flags whatsoever.

    Another way to put it is: if there's pre-context text in the buffer,
    HarfBuzz ignores the BOT flag.  If there's post-context, it ignores
    EOT flag.


Overview of changes leading to 0.9.33
Tuesday, July 22, 2014
=====================================

- Turn off ARabic 'cswh' feature that was accidentally turned on.
- Add HB_TAG_MAX_SIGNED.
- Make hb_face_make_immutable() really make face immutable!
- Windows build fixes.


Overview of changes leading to 0.9.32
Thursday, July 17, 2014
=====================================

- Apply Arabic shaping features in spec order exactly.
- Another fix for Mongolian free variation selectors.
- For non-Arabic scripts in Arabic shaper apply 'rlig' and 'calt'
  together.
- Minor adjustment to U+FFFD logic.
- Fix hb-coretext build.


Overview of changes leading to 0.9.31
Wednesday, July 16, 2014
=====================================

- Only accept valid UTF-8/16/32; we missed many cases before.
- Better shaping of invalid UTF-8/16/32.  Falls back to
  U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER now.
- With all changes in this release, the buffer will contain fully
  valid Unicode after hb_buffer_add_utf8/16/32 no matter how
  broken the input is.  This can be overridden though.  See below.
- Fix Mongolian Variation Selectors for fonts without GDEF.
- Fix minor invalid buffer access.
- Accept zh-Hant and zh-Hans language tags.  hb_ot_tag_to_language()
  now uses these instead of private tags.
- Build fixes.
- New API:
  * hb_buffer_add_codepoints().  This does what hb_buffer_add_utf32()
    used to do, ie. no validity check on the input at all.  add_utf32
    now replaces invalid Unicode codepoints with the replacement
    character (see below).
  * hb_buffer_set_replacement_codepoint()
  * hb_buffer_get_replacement_codepoint()
    Previously, in hb_buffer_add_utf8 and hb_buffer_add_utf16, when
    we detected broken input, we replaced that with (hb_codepoint_t)-1.
    This has changed to use U+FFFD now, but can be changed using these
    new API.

  bindings for all HarfBuzz objects and enums.  Enable using
  --with-gobject.

- Fix undefined memory access.
- Add Javanese config to Indic shaper.
- Misc bug fixes.

Overview of changes leading to 0.9.18
Tuesday, May 28, 2013
=====================================

New build system:

- All unneeded code is all disabled by default,

- Uniscribe and CoreText shapers can be enabled with their --with options,

- icu_le and old shapers cannot be enabled for now,

- glib, freetype, and cairo will be detected automatically.
  They can be force on/off'ed with their --with options,

- icu and graphite2 are default off, can be enabled with their --with
  options,

Moreover, ICU support is now build into a separate library:
libharfbuzz-icu.so, and a new harfbuzz-icu.pc is shipped for it.
Distros can enable ICU now without every application on earth
getting linked to via libharfbuzz.so.

For distros I recommend that they make sure they are building --with-glib
--with-freetype --with-cairo, --with-icu, and optionally --with-graphite2;
And package harfbuzz and harfbuzz-icu separately.


Overview of changes leading to 0.9.17
Monday, May 20, 2013
=====================================

- Build fixes.

Overview of changes leading to 0.9.13
Thursday, February 25, 2013
=====================================

- Build fixes.
- Ngapi HarfBuzz Hackfest in London (February 2013):
  * Fixed all known Indic bugs,
  * New Win8-style Myanmar shaper,
  * New South-East Asian shaper for Tai Tham, Cham, and New Tai Lue,
  * Smartly ignore Default_Ignorable characters (joiners, etc) wheb
    matching GSUB/GPOS lookups,

- Fix possible crasher with broken fonts with overlapping tables.
- Removed generated files from git again.  So, one needs ragel to
  bootstrap from the git tree.

API changes:
- hb_shape() and related APIs now abort if buffer direction is
  HB_DIRECTION_INVALID.  Previously, hb_shape() was calling
  hb_buffer_guess_segment_properties() on the buffer before
  shaping.  The heuristics in that function are fragile.  If the
  user really wants the old behvaior, they can call that function
  right before calling hb_shape() to get the old behavior.
- hb_blob_create_sub_blob() always creates sub-blob with
  HB_MEMORY_MODE_READONLY.  See comments for the reason.
