    * Explanation of partial_vertex_mask:
    *
    * 1. pipe_vertex_state::input::elements have a monotonic logical index
    *    determined by pipe_vertex_state::input::full_velem_mask, specifically,
    *    the position of the i-th bit set is the logical index of the i-th
    *    vertex element, up to 31.
    *
    * 2. pipe_vertex_state::input::partial_velem_mask is a subset of
    *    full_velem_mask where the bits set determine which vertex elements
    *    should be bound contiguously. The vertex elements corresponding to
    *    the bits not set in partial_velem_mask should be ignored.
    *
    * Those two allow creating pipe_vertex_state that has more vertex
    * attributes than the vertex shader has inputs. The idea is that
    * pipe_vertex_state can be used with any vertex shader that has the same
    * number of inputs and same logical indices or less. This may sound like
    * an overly complicated way to bind a subset of vertex elements, but it
    * actually simplifies everything else:
    *
    * - In st/mesa, full_velem_mask is exactly the mask of enabled vertex
    *   attributes (VERT_ATTRIB_x) in the display list VAO, while
    *   partial_velem_mask is exactly the inputs_read mask of the vertex
    *   shader (also VERT_ATTRIB_x).
    *
    * - In the driver, some bit ops and popcnt is needed to assemble vertex
    *   elements very quickly.
