/**
 *  \file SDL_loadso.h
 *
 *  System dependent library loading routines
 *
 *  Some things to keep in mind:
 *  \li These functions only work on C function names.  Other languages may
 *      have name mangling and intrinsic language support that varies from
 *      compiler to compiler.
 *  \li Make sure you declare your function pointers with the same calling
 *      convention as the actual library function.  Your code will crash
 *      mysteriously if you do not do this.
 *  \li Avoid namespace collisions.  If you load a symbol from the library,
 *      it is not defined whether or not it goes into the global symbol
 *      namespace for the application.  If it does and it conflicts with
 *      symbols in your code or other shared libraries, you will not get
 *      the results you expect. :)
