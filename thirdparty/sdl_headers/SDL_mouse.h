/**
 * Capture the mouse and to track input outside an SDL window.
 *
 * Capturing enables your app to obtain mouse events globally, instead of just
 * within your window. Not all video targets support this function. When
 * capturing is enabled, the current window will get all mouse events, but
 * unlike relative mode, no change is made to the cursor and it is not
 * restrained to your window.
 *
 * This function may also deny mouse input to other windows--both those in
 * your application and others on the system--so you should use this function
 * sparingly, and in small bursts. For example, you might want to track the
 * mouse while the user is dragging something, until the user releases a mouse
 * button. It is not recommended that you capture the mouse for long periods
 * of time, such as the entire time your app is running. For that, you should
 * probably use SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode() or SDL_SetWindowGrab(), depending
 * on your goals.
 *
 * While captured, mouse events still report coordinates relative to the
 * current (foreground) window, but those coordinates may be outside the
 * bounds of the window (including negative values). Capturing is only allowed
 * for the foreground window. If the window loses focus while capturing, the
 * capture will be disabled automatically.
 *
 * While capturing is enabled, the current window will have the
 * `SDL_WINDOW_MOUSE_CAPTURE` flag set.
 *
 * Please note that as of SDL 2.0.22, SDL will attempt to "auto capture" the
 * mouse while the user is pressing a button; this is to try and make mouse
 * behavior more consistent between platforms, and deal with the common case
 * of a user dragging the mouse outside of the window. This means that if you
 * are calling SDL_CaptureMouse() only to deal with this situation, you no
 * longer have to (although it is safe to do so). If this causes problems for
 * your app, you can disable auto capture by setting the
 * `SDL_HINT_MOUSE_AUTO_CAPTURE` hint to zero.
 *
 * \param enabled SDL_TRUE to enable capturing, SDL_FALSE to disable.
