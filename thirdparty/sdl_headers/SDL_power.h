 * (especially failing batteries) are delicate hardware, and the values
 * reported here are best estimates based on what that hardware reports. It's

 *
 * Battery status can change at any time; if you are concerned with power
 * state, you should call this function frequently, and perhaps ignore changes
 * until they seem to be stable for a few seconds.
 *
 * It's possible a platform can only report battery percentage or time left
 * but not both.

 * \param seconds seconds of battery life left, you can pass a NULL here if
 *                you don't care, will return -1 if we can't determine a
 *                value, or we're not running on a battery

 *                pass a NULL here if you don't care, will return -1 if we
