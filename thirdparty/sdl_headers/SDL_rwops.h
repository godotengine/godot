/**
 * Use this function to create a new SDL_RWops structure for reading from
 * and/or writing to a named file.
 *
 * The `mode` string is treated roughly the same as in a call to the C
 * library's fopen(), even if SDL doesn't happen to use fopen() behind the
 * scenes.
 *
 * Available `mode` strings:
 *
 * - "r": Open a file for reading. The file must exist.
 * - "w": Create an empty file for writing. If a file with the same name
 *   already exists its content is erased and the file is treated as a new
 *   empty file.
 * - "a": Append to a file. Writing operations append data at the end of the
 *   file. The file is created if it does not exist.
 * - "r+": Open a file for update both reading and writing. The file must
 *   exist.
 * - "w+": Create an empty file for both reading and writing. If a file with
 *   the same name already exists its content is erased and the file is
 *   treated as a new empty file.
 * - "a+": Open a file for reading and appending. All writing operations are
 *   performed at the end of the file, protecting the previous content to be
 *   overwritten. You can reposition (fseek, rewind) the internal pointer to
 *   anywhere in the file for reading, but writing operations will move it
 *   back to the end of file. The file is created if it does not exist.
 *
 * **NOTE**: In order to open a file as a binary file, a "b" character has to
 * be included in the `mode` string. This additional "b" character can either
 * be appended at the end of the string (thus making the following compound
 * modes: "rb", "wb", "ab", "r+b", "w+b", "a+b") or be inserted between the
 * letter and the "+" sign for the mixed modes ("rb+", "wb+", "ab+").
 * Additional characters may follow the sequence, although they should have no
 * effect. For example, "t" is sometimes appended to make explicit the file is
 * a text file.
 *
 * This function supports Unicode filenames, but they must be encoded in UTF-8
 * format, regardless of the underlying operating system.
 *
 * As a fallback, SDL_RWFromFile() will transparently open a matching filename
 * in an Android app's `assets`.
 *
 * Closing the SDL_RWops will close the file handle SDL is holding internally.
 *
 * \param file a UTF-8 string representing the filename to open
 * \param mode an ASCII string representing the mode to be used for opening
 *             the file.
