/**
 *  \file SDL_render.h
 *
 *  Header file for SDL 2D rendering functions.
 *
 *  This API supports the following features:
 *      * single pixel points
 *      * single pixel lines
 *      * filled rectangles
 *      * texture images
 *
 *  The primitives may be drawn in opaque, blended, or additive modes.
 *
 *  The texture images may be drawn in opaque, blended, or additive modes.
 *  They can have an additional color tint or alpha modulation applied to
 *  them, and may also be stretched with linear interpolation.
 *
 *  This API is designed to accelerate simple 2D operations. You may
 *  want more functionality such as polygons and particle effects and
 *  in that case you should use SDL's OpenGL/Direct3D support or one
 *  of the many good 3D engines.
 *
 *  These functions must be called from the main thread.
 *  See this bug for details: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/986
