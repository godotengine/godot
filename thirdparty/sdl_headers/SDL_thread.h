 * for the string length (Haiku has 32 bytes, Linux currently has 16, Visual

 * null-terminated UTF-8, but these guidelines are helpful in choosing a name:
 *
 * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/149932/naming-conventions-for-threads
 *
 * If a system imposes requirements, SDL will try to munge the string for it

 * The size (in bytes) of the new stack can be specified. Zero means "use the
 * system default" which might be wildly different between platforms. x86

 * few kilobytes instead. You generally need to specify a stack that is a
 * multiple of the system's page size (in many cases, this is 4 kilobytes, but
