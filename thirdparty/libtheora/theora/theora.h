 * The libtheora pre-1.0 legacy C API.
 *
 * \ingroup oldfuncs
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * This is the documentation for the libtheora legacy C API, declared in
 * the theora.h header, which describes the old interface used before
 * the 1.0 release. This API was widely deployed for several years and
 * remains supported, but for new code we recommend the cleaner API
 * declared in theoradec.h and theoraenc.h.
 *
 * libtheora is the reference implementation for
 * <a href="http://www.theora.org/">Theora</a>, a free video codec.
 * Theora is derived from On2's VP3 codec with improved integration with
 * Ogg multimedia formats by <a href="http://www.xiph.org/">Xiph.Org</a>.
 *
 * \section overview Overview
 *
 * This library will both decode and encode theora packets to/from raw YUV
 * frames.  In either case, the packets will most likely either come from or
 * need to be embedded in an Ogg stream.  Use
 * <a href="http://xiph.org/ogg/">libogg</a> or
 * <a href="http://www.annodex.net/software/liboggz/index.html">liboggz</a>
 * to extract/package these packets.
 *
 * \section decoding Decoding Process
 *
 * Decoding can be separated into the following steps:
 * -# initialise theora_info and theora_comment structures using
 *    theora_info_init() and theora_comment_init():
 \verbatim
 theora_info     info;
 theora_comment  comment;

 theora_info_init(&info);
 theora_comment_init(&comment);
 \endverbatim
 * -# retrieve header packets from Ogg stream (there should be 3) and decode
 *    into theora_info and theora_comment structures using
 *    theora_decode_header().  See \ref identification for more information on
 *    identifying which packets are theora packets.
 \verbatim
 int i;
 for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
 {
   (get a theora packet "op" from the Ogg stream)
   theora_decode_header(&info, &comment, op);
 }
 \endverbatim
 * -# initialise the decoder based on the information retrieved into the
 *    theora_info struct by theora_decode_header().  You will need a
 *    theora_state struct.
 \verbatim
 theora_state state;

 theora_decode_init(&state, &info);
 \endverbatim
 * -# pass in packets and retrieve decoded frames!  See the yuv_buffer
 *    documentation for information on how to retrieve raw YUV data.
 \verbatim
 yuf_buffer buffer;
 while (last packet was not e_o_s) {
   (get a theora packet "op" from the Ogg stream)
   theora_decode_packetin(&state, op);
   theora_decode_YUVout(&state, &buffer);
 }
 \endverbatim
 *
 *
 * \subsection identification Identifying Theora Packets
 *
 * All streams inside an Ogg file have a unique serial_no attached to the
 * stream.  Typically, you will want to
 *  - retrieve the serial_no for each b_o_s (beginning of stream) page
 *    encountered within the Ogg file;
 *  - test the first (only) packet on that page to determine if it is a theora
 *    packet;
 *  - once you have found a theora b_o_s page then use the retrieved serial_no
 *    to identify future packets belonging to the same theora stream.
 *
 * Note that you \e cannot use theora_packet_isheader() to determine if a
 * packet is a theora packet or not, as this function does not perform any
 * checking beyond whether a header bit is present.  Instead, use the
 * theora_decode_header() function and check the return value; or examine the
 * header bytes at the beginning of the Ogg page.

/**
 * A YUV buffer for passing uncompressed frames to and from the codec.
 * This holds a Y'CbCr frame in planar format. The CbCr planes can be
 * subsampled and have their own separate dimensions and row stride
 * offsets. Note that the strides may be negative in some
 * configurations. For theora the width and height of the largest plane
 * must be a multiple of 16. The actual meaningful picture size and
 * offset are stored in the theora_info structure; frames returned by
 * the decoder may need to be cropped for display.
 *
 * All samples are 8 bits. Within each plane samples are ordered by
 * row from the top of the frame to the bottom. Within each row samples
 * are ordered from left to right.
 *
 * During decode, the yuv_buffer struct is allocated by the user, but all
 * fields (including luma and chroma pointers) are filled by the library.
 * These pointers address library-internal memory and their contents should
 * not be modified.
 *
 * Conversely, during encode the user allocates the struct and fills out all
 * fields.  The user also manages the data addressed by the luma and chroma
 * pointers.  See the encoder_example.c and dump_video.c example files in
 * theora/examples/ for more information.
