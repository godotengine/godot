 * You must link to <tt>libtheoraenc</tt> and <tt>libtheoradec</tt>
 *  if you use any of the functions in this section.
 *
 * The functions are listed in the order they are used in a typical encode.
 * The basic steps are:
 * - Fill in a #th_info structure with details on the format of the video you
 *    wish to encode.
 * - Allocate a #th_enc_ctx handle with th_encode_alloc().
 * - Perform any additional encoder configuration required with
 *    th_encode_ctl().
 * - Repeatedly call th_encode_flushheader() to retrieve all the header
 *    packets.
 * - For each uncompressed frame:
 *   - Submit the uncompressed frame via th_encode_ycbcr_in()
 *   - Repeatedly call th_encode_packetout() to retrieve any video
 *      data packets that are ready.
 * - Call th_encode_free() to release all encoder memory.*/
