# Third party libraries


## certs

- Upstream: ?

TODO.


## enet

- Upstream: http://enet.bespin.org
- Version: 1.3.13
- License: MIT

Files extracted from upstream source:

- all .c files in the main directory (except unix.c win32.c)
- the include/enet/ folder as enet/ (except unix.h win32.h)
- LICENSE file

Important: enet.h, host.c, protocol.c have been slightly modified
to be usable by godot socket implementation and allow IPv6.
Two files (godot.cpp and enet/godot.h) have been added to provide
enet socket implementation using Godot classes.
It is still possible to build against a system wide ENet but doing so
will limit it's functionality to IPv4 only.
Check the diff of enet.h, protocol.c, and host.c with the 1.3.13
tarball before the next update.
