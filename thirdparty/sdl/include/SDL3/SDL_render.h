/**
 * # CategoryRender
 *
 * Header file for SDL 2D rendering functions.
 *
 * This API supports the following features:
 *
 * - single pixel points
 * - single pixel lines
 * - filled rectangles
 * - texture images
 * - 2D polygons
 *
 * The primitives may be drawn in opaque, blended, or additive modes.
 *
 * The texture images may be drawn in opaque, blended, or additive modes. They
 * can have an additional color tint or alpha modulation applied to them, and
 * may also be stretched with linear interpolation.
 *
 * This API is designed to accelerate simple 2D operations. You may want more
 * functionality such as polygons and particle effects and in that case you
 * should use SDL's OpenGL/Direct3D support, the SDL3 GPU API, or one of the
 * many good 3D engines.
 *
 * These functions must be called from the main thread. See this bug for
 * details: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/986

 *   for floating point textures, SDL_COLORSPACE_HDR10 for 10-bit textures,

 * - `SDL_PROP_TEXTURE_CREATE_ACCESS_NUMBER`: one of the enumerated values in

 * pixel.
 *
 * Please note, that in case of rendering to a texture - there is **no need**

 * target to default via `SDL_SetRenderTarget(renderer, NULL)` afterwards, as
