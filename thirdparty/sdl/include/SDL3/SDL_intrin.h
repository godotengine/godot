/* WIKI CATEGORY: Intrinsics */

/**
 * # CategoryIntrinsics
 *
 * SDL does some preprocessor gymnastics to determine if any CPU-specific
 * compiler intrinsics are available, as this is not necessarily an easy thing
 * to calculate, and sometimes depends on quirks of a system, versions of
 * build tools, and other external forces.
 *
 * Apps including SDL's headers will be able to check consistent preprocessor
 * definitions to decide if it's safe to use compiler intrinsics for a
 * specific CPU architecture. This check only tells you that the compiler is
 * capable of using those intrinsics; at runtime, you should still check if
 * they are available on the current system with the
 * [CPU info functions](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryCPUInfo)
 * , such as SDL_HasSSE() or SDL_HasNEON(). Otherwise, the process might crash
 * for using an unsupported CPU instruction.
 *
 * SDL only sets preprocessor defines for CPU intrinsics if they are
 * supported, so apps should check with `#ifdef` and not `#if`.
 *
 * SDL will also include the appropriate instruction-set-specific support
 * headers, so if SDL decides to define SDL_SSE2_INTRINSICS, it will also
 * `#include <emmintrin.h>` as well.

/**
 * A macro to tag a function as targeting a specific CPU architecture.
 *
 * This is a hint to the compiler that a function should be built with support
 * for a CPU instruction set that might be different than the rest of the
 * program.
 *
 * The particulars of this are explained in the GCC documentation:
 *
 * https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Common-Function-Attributes.html#index-target-function-attribute
 *
 * An example of using this feature is to turn on SSE2 support for a specific
 * function, even if the rest of the source code is not compiled to use SSE2
 * code:
 *
 * ```c
 * #ifdef SDL_SSE2_INTRINSICS
 * static void SDL_TARGETING("sse2") DoSomethingWithSSE2(char *x) {
 *    ...use SSE2 intrinsic functions, etc...
 * }
 * #endif
 *
 * // later...
 * #ifdef SDL_SSE2_INTRINSICS
 * if (SDL_HasSSE2()) {
 *     DoSomethingWithSSE2(str);
 * }
 * #endif
 * ```
 *
 * The application is, on a whole, built without SSE2 instructions, so it will
 * run on Intel machines that don't support SSE2. But then at runtime, it
 * checks if the system supports the instructions, and then calls into a
 * function that uses SSE2 opcodes. The ifdefs make sure that this code isn't
 * used on platforms that don't have SSE2 at all.
 *
 * On compilers without target support, this is defined to nothing.
 *
 * This symbol is used by SDL internally, but apps and other libraries are
 * welcome to use it for their own interfaces as well.
 *
 * \since This macro is available since SDL 3.2.0.
