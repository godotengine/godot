 * Open a URL/URI in the browser or other appropriate external application.
 *
 * Open a URL in a separate, system-provided application. How this works will
 * vary wildly depending on the platform. This will likely launch what makes
 * sense to handle a specific URL's protocol (a web browser for `http://`,
 * etc), but it might also be able to launch file managers for directories and
 * other things.
 *
 * What happens when you open a URL varies wildly as well: your game window
 * may lose focus (and may or may not lose focus if your game was fullscreen
 * or grabbing input at the time). On mobile devices, your app will likely
 * move to the background or your process might be paused. Any given platform
 * may or may not handle a given URL.
 *
 * If this is unimplemented (or simply unavailable) for a platform, this will
 * fail with an error. A successful result does not mean the URL loaded, just
 * that we launched _something_ to handle it (or at least believe we did).
 *
 * All this to say: this function can be useful, but you should definitely
 * test it on every platform you target.
 *
 * \param url a valid URL/URI to open. Use `file:///full/path/to/file` for
 *            local files, if supported.
 * \returns true on success or false on failure; call SDL_GetError() for more
 *          information.
 *
 * \since This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
