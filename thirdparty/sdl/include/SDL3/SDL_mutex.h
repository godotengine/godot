 * cover the complicated topic of thread safety, but reading up on what each
 * of these primitives are, why they are useful, and how to correctly use them
 * is vital to writing correct and safe multithreaded programs.
 *
 * - Mutexes: SDL_CreateMutex()
 * - Read/Write locks: SDL_CreateRWLock()
 * - Semaphores: SDL_CreateSemaphore()
 * - Condition variables: SDL_CreateCondition()
 *
 * SDL also offers a datatype, SDL_InitState, which can be used to make sure
 * only one thread initializes/deinitializes some resource that several
 * threads might try to use for the first time simultaneously.
