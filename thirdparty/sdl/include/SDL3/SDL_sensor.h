 * The gyroscope returns the current rate of rotation in radians per second.
 * The rotation is positive in the counter-clockwise direction. That is, an
 * observer looking from a positive location on one of the axes would see
 * positive rotation on that axis when it appeared to be rotating
 * counter-clockwise.
