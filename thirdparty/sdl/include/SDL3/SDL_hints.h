 *
 * This file contains functions to set and get configuration hints, as well as
 * listing each of them alphabetically.
 *
 * The convention for naming hints is SDL_HINT_X, where "SDL_X" is the
 * environment variable that can be used to override the default.
 *
 * In general these hints are just that - they may or may not be supported or
 * applicable on any given platform, but they provide a way for an application
 * or user to give the library a hint as to how they would like the library to
 * work.
