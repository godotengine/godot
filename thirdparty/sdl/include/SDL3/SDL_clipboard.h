 * # CategoryClipboard
 *
 * SDL provides access to the system clipboard, both for reading information
 * from other processes and publishing information of its own.
 *
 * This is not just text! SDL apps can access and publish data by mimetype.
 *
 * ## Basic use (text)
 *
 * Obtaining and publishing simple text to the system clipboard is as easy as
 * calling SDL_GetClipboardText() and SDL_SetClipboardText(), respectively.
 * These deal with C strings in UTF-8 encoding. Data transmission and encoding
 * conversion is completely managed by SDL.
 *
 * ## Clipboard callbacks (data other than text)
 *
 * Things get more complicated when the clipboard contains something other
 * than text. Not only can the system clipboard contain data of any type, in
 * some cases it can contain the same data in different formats! For example,
 * an image painting app might let the user copy a graphic to the clipboard,
 * and offers it in .BMP, .JPG, or .PNG format for other apps to consume.
 *
 * Obtaining clipboard data ("pasting") like this is a matter of calling
 * SDL_GetClipboardData() and telling it the mimetype of the data you want.
 * But how does one know if that format is available? SDL_HasClipboardData()
 * can report if a specific mimetype is offered, and
 * SDL_GetClipboardMimeTypes() can provide the entire list of mimetypes
 * available, so the app can decide what to do with the data and what formats
 * it can support.
 *
 * Setting the clipboard ("copying") to arbitrary data is done with
 * SDL_SetClipboardData. The app does not provide the data in this call, but
 * rather the mimetypes it is willing to provide and a callback function.
 * During the callback, the app will generate the data. This allows massive
 * data sets to be provided to the clipboard, without any data being copied
 * before it is explicitly requested. More specifically, it allows an app to
 * offer data in multiple formats without providing a copy of all of them
 * upfront. If the app has an image that it could provide in PNG or JPG
 * format, it doesn't have to encode it to either of those unless and until
 * something tries to paste it.
 *
 * ## Primary Selection
 *
 * The X11 and Wayland video targets have a concept of the "primary selection"
 * in addition to the usual clipboard. This is generally highlighted (but not
 * explicitly copied) text from various apps. SDL offers APIs for this through
 * SDL_GetPrimarySelectionText() and SDL_SetPrimarySelectionText(). SDL offers
 * these APIs on platforms without this concept, too, but only so far that it
 * will keep a copy of a string that the app sets for later retrieval; the
 * operating system will not ever attempt to change the string externally if
 * it doesn't support a primary selection.
