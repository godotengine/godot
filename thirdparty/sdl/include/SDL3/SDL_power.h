 * You should never take a battery status as absolute truth. Batteries
 * (especially failing batteries) are delicate hardware, and the values
 * reported here are best estimates based on what that hardware reports. It's
 * not uncommon for older batteries to lose stored power much faster than it
 * reports, or completely drain when reporting it has 20 percent left, etc.
 *
 * Battery status can change at any time; if you are concerned with power
 * state, you should call this function frequently, and perhaps ignore changes
 * until they seem to be stable for a few seconds.
 *
 * It's possible a platform can only report battery percentage or time left
 * but not both.
 *
 * On some platforms, retrieving power supply details might be expensive. If
 * you want to display continuous status you could call this function every
 * minute or so.
 *
 * \param seconds a pointer filled in with the seconds of battery life left,
 *                or NULL to ignore. This will be filled in with -1 if we
 *                can't determine a value or there is no battery.
 * \param percent a pointer filled in with the percentage of battery life
 *                left, between 0 and 100, or NULL to ignore. This will be
 *                filled in with -1 we can't determine a value or there is no
 *                battery.
 * \returns the current battery state or `SDL_POWERSTATE_ERROR` on failure;
 *          call SDL_GetError() for more information.
