 * long.  It also wasn't common (or at least as common) in 1994 for INT32 to be
 * defined by platform headers.  Since then, however, INT32 is defined in
 * several other common places:
 *
 * Xmd.h (X11 header) typedefs INT32 to int on 64-bit platforms and long on
 * 32-bit platforms (i.e always a 32-bit signed type.)
 *
 * basetsd.h (Win32 header) typedefs INT32 to int (always a 32-bit signed type
 * on modern platforms.)
 *
 * qglobal.h (Qt header) typedefs INT32 to int (always a 32-bit signed type on
 * modern platforms.)
 *
 * This is a recipe for conflict, since "long" and "int" aren't always
 * compatible types.  Since the definition of INT32 has technically been part
 * of the libjpeg API for more than 20 years, we can't remove it, but we do not
 * use it internally any longer.  We instead define a separate type (JLONG)
 * for internal use, which ensures that internal behavior will always be the
 * same regardless of any external headers that may be included.

/*
 * The RGB_RED, RGB_GREEN, RGB_BLUE, and RGB_PIXELSIZE macros are a vestigial
 * feature of libjpeg.  The idea was that, if an application developer needed
 * to compress from/decompress to a BGR/BGRX/RGBX/XBGR/XRGB buffer, they could
 * change these macros, rebuild libjpeg, and link their application statically
 * with it.  In reality, few people ever did this, because there were some
 * severe restrictions involved (cjpeg and djpeg no longer worked properly,
 * compressing/decompressing RGB JPEGs no longer worked properly, and the color
 * quantizer wouldn't work with pixel sizes other than 3.)  Furthermore, since
 * all of the O/S-supplied versions of libjpeg were built with the default
 * values of RGB_RED, RGB_GREEN, RGB_BLUE, and RGB_PIXELSIZE, many applications
 * have come to regard these values as immutable.
 *
 * The libjpeg-turbo colorspace extensions provide a much cleaner way of
 * compressing from/decompressing to buffers with arbitrary component orders
 * and pixel sizes.  Thus, we do not support changing the values of RGB_RED,
 * RGB_GREEN, RGB_BLUE, or RGB_PIXELSIZE.  In addition to the restrictions
 * listed above, changing these values will also break the SIMD extensions and
 * the regression tests.
