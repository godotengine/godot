 * If get_buffer already contains enough bits, they are fetched in-line
 * by the macros CHECK_BIT_BUFFER and GET_BITS.  When there aren't enough
 * bits, jpeg_fill_bit_buffer is called; it will attempt to fill get_buffer
 * as full as possible (not just to the number of bits needed; this
 * prefetching reduces the overhead cost of calling jpeg_fill_bit_buffer).
 * Note that jpeg_fill_bit_buffer may return FALSE to indicate suspension.
 * On TRUE return, jpeg_fill_bit_buffer guarantees that get_buffer contains
 * at least the requested number of bits --- dummy zeroes are inserted if
 * necessary.

 * Code for extracting next Huffman-coded symbol from input bit stream.

 * without looping.  Usually, more than 95% of the Huffman codes will be 8
 * or fewer bits long.  The few overlength codes are handled with a loop,
 * which need not be inline code.
 *
 * Notes about the HUFF_DECODE macro:
 * 1. Near the end of the data segment, we may fail to get enough bits
 *    for a lookahead.  In that case, we do it the hard way.
 * 2. If the lookahead table contains no entry, the next code must be
 *    more than HUFF_LOOKAHEAD bits long.
