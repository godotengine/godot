/**
 * \file ctr_drbg.h
 *
 * \brief    This file contains definitions and functions for the
 *           CTR_DRBG pseudorandom generator.
 *
 * CTR_DRBG is a standardized way of building a PRNG from a block-cipher
 * in counter mode operation, as defined in <em>NIST SP 800-90A:
 * Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random
 * Bit Generators</em>.
 *
 * The Mbed TLS implementation of CTR_DRBG uses AES-256 (default) or AES-128
 * (if \c MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_USE_128_BIT_KEY is enabled at compile time)
 * as the underlying block cipher, with a derivation function.
 *
 * The security strength as defined in NIST SP 800-90A is
 * 128 bits when AES-128 is used (\c MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_USE_128_BIT_KEY enabled)
 * and 256 bits otherwise, provided that #MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_ENTROPY_LEN is
 * kept at its default value (and not overridden in mbedtls_config.h) and that the
 * DRBG instance is set up with default parameters.
 * See the documentation of mbedtls_ctr_drbg_seed() for more
 * information.

 * You can override it by calling mbedtls_ctr_drbg_set_entropy_len().
 *
 * The entropy nonce length is:
 * - \c 0 if the entropy length is at least 3/2 times the entropy length,

 *   by the key size and entropy length according to NIST SP 800-90A ยง10.2.1;

 * With the default entropy length, the entropy nonce length is
 * #MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_ENTROPY_NONCE_LEN.

 * entropy source, to make this instantiation as unique as possible.
