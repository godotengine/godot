 * Uncomment this option to prevent the use of double-width division.
 *
 * Note that division for the native integer type is always required.
 * Furthermore, a 64-bit type is always required even on a 32-bit
 * platform, but it need not support multiplication or division. In some

/**
 * \def MBEDTLS_CHECK_PARAMS
 *
 * This configuration option controls whether the library validates more of
 * the parameters passed to it.
 *
 * When this flag is not defined, the library only attempts to validate an
 * input parameter if: (1) they may come from the outside world (such as the
 * network, the filesystem, etc.) or (2) not validating them could result in
 * internal memory errors such as overflowing a buffer controlled by the
 * library. On the other hand, it doesn't attempt to validate parameters whose
 * values are fully controlled by the application (such as pointers).
 *
 * When this flag is defined, the library additionally attempts to validate
 * parameters that are fully controlled by the application, and should always
 * be valid if the application code is fully correct and trusted.
 *
 * For example, when a function accepts as input a pointer to a buffer that may
 * contain untrusted data, and its documentation mentions that this pointer
 * must not be NULL:
 * - The pointer is checked to be non-NULL only if this option is enabled.
 * - The content of the buffer is always validated.
 *
 * When this flag is defined, if a library function receives a parameter that
 * is invalid:
 * 1. The function will invoke the macro MBEDTLS_PARAM_FAILED().
 * 2. If MBEDTLS_PARAM_FAILED() did not terminate the program, the function
 *   will immediately return. If the function returns an Mbed TLS error code,
 *   the error code in this case is MBEDTLS_ERR_xxx_BAD_INPUT_DATA.
 *
 * When defining this flag, you also need to arrange a definition for
 * MBEDTLS_PARAM_FAILED(). You can do this by any of the following methods:
 * - By default, the library defines MBEDTLS_PARAM_FAILED() to call a
 *   function mbedtls_param_failed(), but the library does not define this
 *   function. If you do not make any other arrangements, you must provide
 *   the function mbedtls_param_failed() in your application.
 *   See `platform_util.h` for its prototype.
 * - If you enable the macro #MBEDTLS_CHECK_PARAMS_ASSERT, then the
 *   library defines MBEDTLS_PARAM_FAILED(\c cond) to be `assert(cond)`.
 *   You can still supply an alternative definition of
 *   MBEDTLS_PARAM_FAILED(), which may call `assert`.
 * - If you define a macro MBEDTLS_PARAM_FAILED() before including `config.h`
 *   or you uncomment the definition of MBEDTLS_PARAM_FAILED() in `config.h`,
 *   the library will call the macro that you defined and will not supply
 *   its own version. Note that if MBEDTLS_PARAM_FAILED() calls `assert`,
 *   you need to enable #MBEDTLS_CHECK_PARAMS_ASSERT so that library source
 *   files include `<assert.h>`.
 *
 * Uncomment to enable validation of application-controlled parameters.

 * \def MBEDTLS_ECP_INTERNAL_ALT
 *
 * Expose a part of the internal interface of the Elliptic Curve Point module.
 *
 * MBEDTLS_ECP__FUNCTION_NAME__ALT: Uncomment a macro to let Mbed TLS use your
 * alternative core implementation of elliptic curve arithmetic. Keep in mind
 * that function prototypes should remain the same.
 *
 * This partially replaces one function. The header file from Mbed TLS is still
 * used, in contrast to the MBEDTLS_ECP_ALT flag. The original implementation
 * is still present and it is used for group structures not supported by the
 * alternative.
 *
 * The original implementation can in addition be removed by setting the
 * MBEDTLS_ECP_NO_FALLBACK option, in which case any function for which the
 * corresponding MBEDTLS_ECP__FUNCTION_NAME__ALT macro is defined will not be
 * able to fallback to curves not supported by the alternative implementation.
 *
 * Any of these options become available by defining MBEDTLS_ECP_INTERNAL_ALT
 * and implementing the following functions:
 *      unsigned char mbedtls_internal_ecp_grp_capable(
 *          const mbedtls_ecp_group *grp )
 *      int  mbedtls_internal_ecp_init( const mbedtls_ecp_group *grp )
 *      void mbedtls_internal_ecp_free( const mbedtls_ecp_group *grp )
 * The mbedtls_internal_ecp_grp_capable function should return 1 if the
 * replacement functions implement arithmetic for the given group and 0
 * otherwise.
 * The functions mbedtls_internal_ecp_init and mbedtls_internal_ecp_free are
 * called before and after each point operation and provide an opportunity to
 * implement optimized set up and tear down instructions.
 *
 * Example: In case you set MBEDTLS_ECP_INTERNAL_ALT and
 * MBEDTLS_ECP_DOUBLE_JAC_ALT, Mbed TLS will still provide the ecp_double_jac()
 * function, but will use your mbedtls_internal_ecp_double_jac() if the group
 * for the operation is supported by your implementation (i.e. your
 * mbedtls_internal_ecp_grp_capable() function returns 1 for this group). If the
 * group is not supported by your implementation, then the original Mbed TLS
 * implementation of ecp_double_jac() is used instead, unless this fallback
 * behaviour is disabled by setting MBEDTLS_ECP_NO_FALLBACK (in which case
 * ecp_double_jac() will return MBEDTLS_ERR_ECP_FEATURE_UNAVAILABLE).
 *
 * The function prototypes and the definition of mbedtls_ecp_group and
 * mbedtls_ecp_point will not change based on MBEDTLS_ECP_INTERNAL_ALT, so your
 * implementation of mbedtls_internal_ecp__function_name__ must be compatible
 * with their definitions.
 *

 *
 * This is useful in non-threaded environments if you want to avoid blocking
 * for too long on ECC (and, hence, X.509 or SSL/TLS) operations.
 *
 * This option:
 * - Adds xxx_restartable() variants of existing operations in the
 *   following modules, with corresponding restart context types:
 *   - ECP (for Short Weierstrass curves only): scalar multiplication (mul),
 *     linear combination (muladd);
 *   - ECDSA: signature generation & verification;
 *   - PK: signature generation & verification;
 *   - X509: certificate chain verification.
 * - Adds mbedtls_ecdh_enable_restart() in the ECDH module.
 * - Changes the behaviour of TLS 1.2 clients (not servers) when using the
 *   ECDHE-ECDSA key exchange (not other key exchanges) to make all ECC
 *   computations restartable:
 *   - ECDH operations from the key exchange, only for Short Weierstrass
 *     curves;
 *   - verification of the server's key exchange signature;
 *   - verification of the server's certificate chain;
 *   - generation of the client's signature if client authentication is used,
 *     with an ECC key/certificate.

/**
 * \brief       This macro is invoked by the library when an invalid parameter
 *              is detected that is only checked with #MBEDTLS_CHECK_PARAMS
 *              (see the documentation of that option for context).
 *
 *              When you leave this undefined here, the library provides
 *              a default definition. If the macro #MBEDTLS_CHECK_PARAMS_ASSERT
 *              is defined, the default definition is `assert(cond)`,
 *              otherwise the default definition calls a function
 *              mbedtls_param_failed(). This function is declared in
 *              `platform_util.h` for the benefit of the library, but
 *              you need to define in your application.
 *
 *              When you define this here, this replaces the default
 *              definition in platform_util.h (which no longer declares the
 *              function mbedtls_param_failed()) and it is your responsibility
 *              to make sure this macro expands to something suitable (in
 *              particular, that all the necessary declarations are visible
 *              from within the library - you can ensure that by providing
 *              them in this file next to the macro definition).
 *              If you define this macro to call `assert`, also define
 *              #MBEDTLS_CHECK_PARAMS_ASSERT so that library source files
 *              include `<assert.h>`.
 *
 *              Note that you may define this macro to expand to nothing, in
 *              which case you don't have to worry about declarations or
 *              definitions. However, you will then be notified about invalid
 *              parameters only in non-void functions, and void function will
 *              just silently return early on invalid parameters, which
 *              partially negates the benefits of enabling
 *              #MBEDTLS_CHECK_PARAMS in the first place, so is discouraged.
