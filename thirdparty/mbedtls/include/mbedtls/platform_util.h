 * \brief       Securely zeroize a buffer
 *
 *              The function is meant to wipe the data contained in a buffer so
 *              that it can no longer be recovered even if the program memory
 *              is later compromised. Call this function on sensitive data
 *              stored on the stack before returning from a function, and on
 *              sensitive data stored on the heap before freeing the heap
 *              object.
 *
 *              It is extremely difficult to guarantee that calls to
 *              mbedtls_platform_zeroize() are not removed by aggressive
 *              compiler optimizations in a portable way. For this reason, Mbed
 *              TLS provides the configuration option
 *              MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_ZEROIZE_ALT, which allows users to configure
 *              mbedtls_platform_zeroize() to use a suitable implementation for
 *              their platform and needs
 *
 * \param buf   Buffer to be zeroized
 * \param len   Length of the buffer in bytes

 * \brief      Platform-specific implementation of gmtime_r()
 *
 *             The function is a thread-safe abstraction that behaves
 *             similarly to the gmtime_r() function from Unix/POSIX.
 *
 *             Mbed TLS will try to identify the underlying platform and
 *             make use of an appropriate underlying implementation (e.g.
 *             gmtime_r() for POSIX and gmtime_s() for Windows). If this is
 *             not possible, then gmtime() will be used. In this case, calls
 *             from the library to gmtime() will be guarded by the mutex
 *             mbedtls_threading_gmtime_mutex if MBEDTLS_THREADING_C is
 *             enabled. It is recommended that calls from outside the library
 *             are also guarded by this mutex.
 *
 *             If MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_GMTIME_R_ALT is defined, then Mbed TLS will
 *             unconditionally use the alternative implementation for
 *             mbedtls_platform_gmtime_r() supplied by the user at compile time.
 *
 * \param tt     Pointer to an object containing time (in seconds) since the
 *               epoch to be converted
 * \param tm_buf Pointer to an object where the results will be stored
 *
 * \return      Pointer to an object of type struct tm on success, otherwise
 *              NULL
