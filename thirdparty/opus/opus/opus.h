 * @mainpage Opus
 *
 * The Opus codec is designed for interactive speech and audio transmission over the Internet.
 * It is designed by the IETF Codec Working Group and incorporates technology from
 * Skype's SILK codec and Xiph.Org's CELT codec.
 *
 * The Opus codec is designed to handle a wide range of interactive audio applications,
 * including Voice over IP, videoconferencing, in-game chat, and even remote live music
 * performances. It can scale from low bit-rate narrowband speech to very high quality
 * stereo music. Its main features are:

 * @li Sampling rates from 8 to 48 kHz
 * @li Bit-rates from 6 kb/s to 510 kb/s
 * @li Support for both constant bit-rate (CBR) and variable bit-rate (VBR)
 * @li Audio bandwidth from narrowband to full-band
 * @li Support for speech and music
 * @li Support for mono and stereo
 * @li Support for multichannel (up to 255 channels)
 * @li Frame sizes from 2.5 ms to 60 ms
 * @li Good loss robustness and packet loss concealment (PLC)
 * @li Floating point and fixed-point implementation
 *

/** @defgroup opus_encoder Opus Encoder
  * @{
  *
  * @brief This page describes the process and functions used to encode Opus.
  *
  * Since Opus is a stateful codec, the encoding process starts with creating an encoder
  * state. This can be done with:
  *
  * @code
  * int          error;
  * OpusEncoder *enc;
  * enc = opus_encoder_create(Fs, channels, application, &error);
  * @endcode
  *
  * From this point, @c enc can be used for encoding an audio stream. An encoder state
  * @b must @b not be used for more than one stream at the same time. Similarly, the encoder
  * state @b must @b not be re-initialized for each frame.
  *
  * While opus_encoder_create() allocates memory for the state, it's also possible
  * to initialize pre-allocated memory:
  *
  * @code
  * int          size;
  * int          error;
  * OpusEncoder *enc;
  * size = opus_encoder_get_size(channels);
  * enc = malloc(size);
  * error = opus_encoder_init(enc, Fs, channels, application);
  * @endcode
  *
  * where opus_encoder_get_size() returns the required size for the encoder state. Note that
  * future versions of this code may change the size, so no assuptions should be made about it.
  *
  * The encoder state is always continuous in memory and only a shallow copy is sufficient
  * to copy it (e.g. memcpy())
  *
  * It is possible to change some of the encoder's settings using the opus_encoder_ctl()
  * interface. All these settings already default to the recommended value, so they should
  * only be changed when necessary. The most common settings one may want to change are:
  *
  * @code
  * opus_encoder_ctl(enc, OPUS_SET_BITRATE(bitrate));
  * opus_encoder_ctl(enc, OPUS_SET_COMPLEXITY(complexity));
  * opus_encoder_ctl(enc, OPUS_SET_SIGNAL(signal_type));
  * @endcode
  *
  * where
  *
  * @arg bitrate is in bits per second (b/s)
  * @arg complexity is a value from 1 to 10, where 1 is the lowest complexity and 10 is the highest
  * @arg signal_type is either OPUS_AUTO (default), OPUS_SIGNAL_VOICE, or OPUS_SIGNAL_MUSIC
  *
  * See @ref opus_encoderctls and @ref opus_genericctls for a complete list of parameters that can be set or queried. Most parameters can be set or changed at any time during a stream.
  *
  * To encode a frame, opus_encode() or opus_encode_float() must be called with exactly one frame (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 or 60 ms) of audio data:
  * @code
  * len = opus_encode(enc, audio_frame, frame_size, packet, max_packet);
  * @endcode
  *
  * where
  * <ul>
  * <li>audio_frame is the audio data in opus_int16 (or float for opus_encode_float())</li>
  * <li>frame_size is the duration of the frame in samples (per channel)</li>
  * <li>packet is the byte array to which the compressed data is written</li>
  * <li>max_packet is the maximum number of bytes that can be written in the packet (4000 bytes is recommended).
  *     Do not use max_packet to control VBR target bitrate, instead use the #OPUS_SET_BITRATE CTL.</li>
  * </ul>
  *
  * opus_encode() and opus_encode_float() return the number of bytes actually written to the packet.
  * The return value <b>can be negative</b>, which indicates that an error has occurred. If the return value
  * is 1 byte, then the packet does not need to be transmitted (DTX).
  *
  * Once the encoder state if no longer needed, it can be destroyed with
  *
  * @code
  * opus_encoder_destroy(enc);
  * @endcode
  *
  * If the encoder was created with opus_encoder_init() rather than opus_encoder_create(),
  * then no action is required aside from potentially freeing the memory that was manually
  * allocated for it (calling free(enc) for the example above)
  *

  *
  * The decoder state is always continuous in memory and only a shallow copy is sufficient

  *
  * To decode a frame, opus_decode() or opus_decode_float() must be called with a packet of compressed audio data:

  * If that value is negative, then an error has occurred. This can occur if the packet is corrupted or if the audio

/** @defgroup opus_repacketizer Repacketizer
  * @{
  *
  * The repacketizer can be used to merge multiple Opus packets into a single
  * packet or alternatively to split Opus packets that have previously been
  * merged. Splitting valid Opus packets is always guaranteed to succeed,
  * whereas merging valid packets only succeeds if all frames have the same
  * mode, bandwidth, and frame size, and when the total duration of the merged
  * packet is no more than 120 ms. The 120 ms limit comes from the
  * specification and limits decoder memory requirements at a point where
  * framing overhead becomes negligible.
  *
  * The repacketizer currently only operates on elementary Opus
  * streams. It will not manipualte multistream packets successfully, except in
  * the degenerate case where they consist of data from a single stream.
  *
  * The repacketizing process starts with creating a repacketizer state, either
  * by calling opus_repacketizer_create() or by allocating the memory yourself,
  * e.g.,
  * @code
  * OpusRepacketizer *rp;
  * rp = (OpusRepacketizer*)malloc(opus_repacketizer_get_size());
  * if (rp != NULL)
  *     opus_repacketizer_init(rp);
  * @endcode
  *
  * Then the application should submit packets with opus_repacketizer_cat(),
  * extract new packets with opus_repacketizer_out() or
  * opus_repacketizer_out_range(), and then reset the state for the next set of
  * input packets via opus_repacketizer_init().
  *
  * For example, to split a sequence of packets into individual frames:
  * @code
  * unsigned char *data;
  * int len;
  * while (get_next_packet(&data, &len))
  * {
  *   unsigned char out[1276];
  *   opus_int32 out_len;
  *   int nb_frames;
  *   int err;
  *   int i;
  *   err = opus_repacketizer_cat(rp, data, len);
  *   if (err != OPUS_OK)
  *   {
  *     release_packet(data);
  *     return err;
  *   }
  *   nb_frames = opus_repacketizer_get_nb_frames(rp);
  *   for (i = 0; i < nb_frames; i++)
  *   {
  *     out_len = opus_repacketizer_out_range(rp, i, i+1, out, sizeof(out));
  *     if (out_len < 0)
  *     {
  *        release_packet(data);
  *        return (int)out_len;
  *     }
  *     output_next_packet(out, out_len);
  *   }
  *   opus_repacketizer_init(rp);
  *   release_packet(data);
  * }
  * @endcode
  *
  * Alternatively, to combine a sequence of frames into packets that each
  * contain up to <code>TARGET_DURATION_MS</code> milliseconds of data:
  * @code
  * // The maximum number of packets with duration TARGET_DURATION_MS occurs
  * // when the frame size is 2.5 ms, for a total of (TARGET_DURATION_MS*2/5)
  * // packets.
  * unsigned char *data[(TARGET_DURATION_MS*2/5)+1];
  * opus_int32 len[(TARGET_DURATION_MS*2/5)+1];
  * int nb_packets;
  * unsigned char out[1277*(TARGET_DURATION_MS*2/2)];
  * opus_int32 out_len;
  * int prev_toc;
  * nb_packets = 0;
  * while (get_next_packet(data+nb_packets, len+nb_packets))
  * {
  *   int nb_frames;
  *   int err;
  *   nb_frames = opus_packet_get_nb_frames(data[nb_packets], len[nb_packets]);
  *   if (nb_frames < 1)
  *   {
  *     release_packets(data, nb_packets+1);
  *     return nb_frames;
  *   }
  *   nb_frames += opus_repacketizer_get_nb_frames(rp);
  *   // If adding the next packet would exceed our target, or it has an
  *   // incompatible TOC sequence, output the packets we already have before
  *   // submitting it.
  *   // N.B., The nb_packets > 0 check ensures we've submitted at least one
  *   // packet since the last call to opus_repacketizer_init(). Otherwise a
  *   // single packet longer than TARGET_DURATION_MS would cause us to try to

  *   // guaranteed by the call to opus_packet_get_nb_frames() above, so the
