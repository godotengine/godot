		Exporter for the Web.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The Web exporter customizes how a web build is handled. In the editor's "Export" window, it is created when adding a new "Web" preset.
		[b]Note:[/b] Godot on Web is rendered inside a [code]&lt;canvas&gt;[/code] tag. Normally, the canvas cannot be positioned or resized manually, but otherwise acts as the main [Window] of the application.
