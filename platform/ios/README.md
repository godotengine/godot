# iOS platform port

This folder contains the C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ code for the iOS
platform port.

This platform derives from the Apple embedded abstract platform ([`drivers/apple_embedded`](/drivers/apple_embedded)).

This platform uses shared Apple code ([`drivers/apple`](/drivers/apple)).

See also [`misc/dist/apple_embedded_xcode`](/misc/dist/apple_embedded_xcode) folder for the Xcode
project template used for packaging the iOS export templates.
