	<description>
		[PhysicsBody2D] is an abstract base class for 2D game objects affected by physics. All 2D physics bodies inherit from it.

	<methods>
		<method name="add_collision_exception_with">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="body" type="Node" />
			<description>
				Adds a body to the list of bodies that this body can't collide with.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_collision_exceptions">
			<return type="PhysicsBody2D[]" />
			<description>
				Returns an array of nodes that were added as collision exceptions for this body.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_gravity" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Vector2" />
			<description>
				Returns the gravity vector computed from all sources that can affect the body, including all gravity overrides from [Area2D] nodes and the global world gravity.

		<method name="move_and_collide">
			<return type="KinematicCollision2D" />
			<param index="0" name="motion" type="Vector2" />
			<param index="1" name="test_only" type="bool" default="false" />
			<param index="2" name="safe_margin" type="float" default="0.08" />
			<param index="3" name="recovery_as_collision" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Moves the body along the vector [param motion]. In order to be frame rate independent in [method Node._physics_process] or [method Node._process], [param motion] should be computed using [code]delta[/code].
				Returns a [KinematicCollision2D], which contains information about the collision when stopped, or when touching another body along the motion.
				If [param test_only] is [code]true[/code], the body does not move but the would-be collision information is given.
				[param safe_margin] is the extra margin used for collision recovery (see [member CharacterBody2D.safe_margin] for more details).
				If [param recovery_as_collision] is [code]true[/code], any depenetration from the recovery phase is also reported as a collision; this is used e.g. by [CharacterBody2D] for improving floor detection during floor snapping.

		<method name="remove_collision_exception_with">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="body" type="Node" />
			<description>
				Removes a body from the list of bodies that this body can't collide with.

		<method name="test_move" keywords="check, collision, sweep">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="from" type="Transform2D" />
			<param index="1" name="motion" type="Vector2" />
			<param index="2" name="collision" type="KinematicCollision2D" default="null" />
			<param index="3" name="safe_margin" type="float" default="0.08" />
			<param index="4" name="recovery_as_collision" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Checks for collisions without moving the body. In order to be frame rate independent in [method Node._physics_process] or [method Node._process], [param motion] should be computed using [code]delta[/code].
				Virtually sets the node's position, scale and rotation to that of the given [Transform2D], then tries to move the body along the vector [param motion]. Returns [code]true[/code] if a collision would stop the body from moving along the whole path.
				[param collision] is an optional object of type [KinematicCollision2D], which contains additional information about the collision when stopped, or when touching another body along the motion.
				[param safe_margin] is the extra margin used for collision recovery (see [member CharacterBody2D.safe_margin] for more details).
				If [param recovery_as_collision] is [code]true[/code], any depenetration from the recovery phase is also reported as a collision; this is useful for checking whether the body would [i]touch[/i] any other bodies.
