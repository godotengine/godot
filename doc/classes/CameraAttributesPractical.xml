		Camera settings in an easy to use format.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Controls camera-specific attributes such as auto-exposure, depth of field, and exposure override.
		When used in a [WorldEnvironment] it provides default settings for exposure, auto-exposure, and depth of field that will be used by all cameras without their own [CameraAttributes], including the editor camera. When used in a [Camera3D] it will override any [CameraAttributes] set in the [WorldEnvironment]. When used in [VoxelGI] or [LightmapGI], only the exposure settings will be used.

		<member name="auto_exposure_max_sensitivity" type="float" setter="set_auto_exposure_max_sensitivity" getter="get_auto_exposure_max_sensitivity" default="800.0">
			The maximum sensitivity (in ISO) used when calculating auto exposure. When calculating scene average luminance, color values will be clamped to at least this value. This limits the auto-exposure from exposing below a certain brightness, resulting in a cut off point where the scene will remain bright.
		</member>
		<member name="auto_exposure_min_sensitivity" type="float" setter="set_auto_exposure_min_sensitivity" getter="get_auto_exposure_min_sensitivity" default="0.0">
			The minimum sensitivity (in ISO) used when calculating auto exposure. When calculating scene average luminance, color values will be clamped to at least this value. This limits the auto-exposure from exposing above a certain brightness, resulting in a cut off point where the scene will remain dark.

		<member name="dof_blur_amount" type="float" setter="set_dof_blur_amount" getter="get_dof_blur_amount" default="0.1">
			Sets the maximum amount of blur. When using physically-based blur amounts, will instead act as a multiplier. High values lead to an increased amount of blurriness, but can be much more expensive to calculate. It is best to keep this as low as possible for a given art style.

		<member name="dof_blur_far_distance" type="float" setter="set_dof_blur_far_distance" getter="get_dof_blur_far_distance" default="10.0">
			Objects further from the [Camera3D] by this amount will be blurred by the depth of field effect. Measured in meters.

			Enables depth of field blur for objects further than [member dof_blur_far_distance]. Strength of blur is controlled by [member dof_blur_amount] and modulated by [member dof_blur_far_transition].
			[b]Note:[/b] Depth of field blur is only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile rendering methods, not Compatibility.
			[b]Note:[/b] Depth of field blur is not supported on viewports that have a transparent background (where [member Viewport.transparent_bg] is [code]true[/code]).

			When positive, distance over which (starting from [member dof_blur_far_distance]) blur effect will scale from 0 to [member dof_blur_amount]. When negative, uses physically-based scaling so depth of field effect will scale from 0 at [member dof_blur_far_distance] and will increase in a physically accurate way as objects get further from the [Camera3D].
