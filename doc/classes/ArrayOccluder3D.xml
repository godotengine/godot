	<brief_description>
		3D polygon shape for use with occlusion culling in [OccluderInstance3D].
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[ArrayOccluder3D] stores an arbitrary 3D polygon shape that can be used by the engine's occlusion culling system. This is analogous to [ArrayMesh], but for occluders.
		See [OccluderInstance3D]'s documentation for instructions on setting up occlusion culling.

			The occluder's index position. Indices determine which points from the [member vertices] array should be drawn, and in which order.
			[b]Note:[/b] The occluder is always updated after setting this value. If creating occluders procedurally, consider using [method set_arrays] instead to avoid updating the occluder twice when it's created.

			The occluder's vertex positions in local 3D coordinates.
