		Base object in 3D space, inherited by all 3D nodes.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The [Node3D] node is the base representation of a node in 3D space. All other 3D nodes inherit from this class.
		Affine operations (translation, rotation, scale) are calculated in the coordinate system relative to the parent, unless the [Node3D]'s [member top_level] is [code]true[/code]. In this coordinate system, affine operations correspond to direct affine operations on the [Node3D]'s [member transform]. The term [i]parent space[/i] refers to this coordinate system. The coordinate system that is attached to the [Node3D] itself is referred to as object-local coordinate system, or [i]local space[/i].
		[b]Note:[/b] Unless otherwise specified, all methods that need angle parameters must receive angles in [i]radians[/i]. To convert degrees to radians, use [method @GlobalScope.deg_to_rad].
		[b]Note:[/b] In Godot 3 and older, [Node3D] was named [i]Spatial[/i].

	<methods>
		<method name="add_gizmo">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="gizmo" type="Node3DGizmo" />
			<description>
				Attaches the given [param gizmo] to this node. Only works in the editor.
				[b]Note:[/b] [param gizmo] should be an [EditorNode3DGizmo]. The argument type is [Node3DGizmo] to avoid depending on editor classes in [Node3D].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="clear_gizmos">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Clears all [EditorNode3DGizmo] objects attached to this node. Only works in the editor.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="clear_subgizmo_selection">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Deselects all subgizmos for this node. Useful to call when the selected subgizmo may no longer exist after a property change. Only works in the editor.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="force_update_transform">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Forces the node's [member global_transform] to update, by sending [constant NOTIFICATION_TRANSFORM_CHANGED]. Fails if the node is not inside the tree.
				[b]Note:[/b] For performance reasons, transform changes are usually accumulated and applied [i]once[/i] at the end of the frame. The update propagates through [Node3D] children, as well. Therefore, use this method only when you need an up-to-date transform (such as during physics operations).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_gizmos" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Node3DGizmo[]" />
			<description>
				Returns all the [EditorNode3DGizmo] objects attached to this node. Only works in the editor.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_global_transform_interpolated">
			<return type="Transform3D" />
			<description>
				When using physics interpolation, there will be circumstances in which you want to know the interpolated (displayed) transform of a node rather than the standard transform (which may only be accurate to the most recent physics tick).
				This is particularly important for frame-based operations that take place in [method Node._process], rather than [method Node._physics_process]. Examples include [Camera3D]s focusing on a node, or finding where to fire lasers from on a frame rather than physics tick.
				[b]Note:[/b] This function creates an interpolation pump on the [Node3D] the first time it is called, which can respond to physics interpolation resets. If you get problems with "streaking" when initially following a [Node3D], be sure to call [method get_global_transform_interpolated] at least once [i]before[/i] resetting the [Node3D] physics interpolation.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_parent_node_3d" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Node3D" />
			<description>
				Returns the parent [Node3D] that directly affects this node's [member global_transform]. Returns [code]null[/code] if no parent exists, the parent is not a [Node3D], or [member top_level] is [code]true[/code].
				[b]Note:[/b] This method is not always equivalent to [method Node.get_parent], which does not take [member top_level] into account.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_world_3d" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="World3D" />
			<description>
				Returns the [World3D] this node is registered to.
				Usually, this is the same as the world used by this node's viewport (see [method Node.get_viewport] and [method Viewport.find_world_3d]).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="global_rotate">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="axis" type="Vector3" />
			<param index="1" name="angle" type="float" />
			<description>
				Rotates this node's [member global_basis] around the global [param axis] by the given [param angle], in radians. This operation is calculated in global space (relative to the world) and preserves the [member global_position].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="global_scale">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="scale" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Scales this node's [member global_basis] by the given [param scale] factor. This operation is calculated in global space (relative to the world) and preserves the [member global_position].
				[b]Note:[/b] This method is not to be confused with the [member scale] property.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="global_translate">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="offset" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Adds the given translation [param offset] to the node's [member global_position] in global space (relative to the world).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="hide">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Prevents this node from being rendered. Equivalent to setting [member visible] to [code]false[/code]. This is the opposite of [method show].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_local_transform_notification_enabled" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the node receives [constant NOTIFICATION_LOCAL_TRANSFORM_CHANGED] whenever [member transform] changes. This is enabled with [method set_notify_local_transform].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_scale_disabled" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if this node's [member global_transform] is automatically orthonormalized. This results in this node not appearing distorted, as if its global scale were set to [constant Vector3.ONE] (or its negative counterpart). See also [method set_disable_scale] and [method orthonormalize].
				[b]Note:[/b] [member transform] is not affected by this setting.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_transform_notification_enabled" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the node receives [constant NOTIFICATION_TRANSFORM_CHANGED] whenever [member global_transform] changes. This is enabled with [method set_notify_transform].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_visible_in_tree" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if this node is inside the scene tree and the [member visible] property is [code]true[/code] for this node and all of its [Node3D] ancestors [i]in sequence[/i]. An ancestor of any other type (such as [Node] or [Node2D]) breaks the sequence. See also [method Node.get_parent].
				[b]Note:[/b] This method cannot take [member VisualInstance3D.layers] into account, so even if this method returns [code]true[/code], the node may not be rendered.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="look_at">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="target" type="Vector3" />
			<param index="1" name="up" type="Vector3" default="Vector3(0, 1, 0)" />
			<param index="2" name="use_model_front" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Rotates the node so that the local forward axis (-Z, [constant Vector3.FORWARD]) points toward the [param target] position. This operation is calculated in global space (relative to the world).
				The local up axis (+Y) points as close to the [param up] vector as possible while staying perpendicular to the local forward axis. The resulting transform is orthogonal, and the scale is preserved. Non-uniform scaling may not work correctly.
				The [param target] position cannot be the same as the node's position, the [param up] vector cannot be [constant Vector3.ZERO]. Furthermore, the direction from the node's position to the [param target] position cannot be parallel to the [param up] vector, to avoid an unintended rotation around the local Z axis.
				If [param use_model_front] is [code]true[/code], the +Z axis (asset front) is treated as forward (implies +X is left) and points toward the [param target] position. By default, the -Z axis (camera forward) is treated as forward (implies +X is right).
				[b]Note:[/b] This method fails if the node is not in the scene tree. If necessary, use [method look_at_from_position] instead.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="look_at_from_position">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="position" type="Vector3" />
			<param index="1" name="target" type="Vector3" />
			<param index="2" name="up" type="Vector3" default="Vector3(0, 1, 0)" />
			<param index="3" name="use_model_front" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Moves the node to the specified [param position], then rotates the node to point toward the [param target] position, similar to [method look_at]. This operation is calculated in global space (relative to the world).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="orthonormalize">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Orthonormalizes this node's [member basis]. This method sets this node's [member scale] to [constant Vector3.ONE] (or its negative counterpart), but preserves the [member position] and [member rotation]. See also [method Transform3D.orthonormalized].
			</description>

			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="disable" type="bool" />
			<description>
				If [code]true[/code], this node's [member global_transform] is automatically orthonormalized. This results in this node not appearing distorted, as if its global scale were set to [constant Vector3.ONE] (or its negative counterpart). See also [method is_scale_disabled] and [method orthonormalize].
				[b]Note:[/b] [member transform] is not affected by this setting.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_identity">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Sets this node's [member transform] to [constant Transform3D.IDENTITY], which resets all transformations in parent space ([member position], [member rotation], and [member scale]).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_ignore_transform_notification">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="enabled" type="bool" />
			<description>
				If [code]true[/code], the node will not receive [constant NOTIFICATION_TRANSFORM_CHANGED] or [constant NOTIFICATION_LOCAL_TRANSFORM_CHANGED].
				It may useful to call this method when handling these notifications to prevent infinite recursion.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_notify_local_transform">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="enable" type="bool" />
			<description>
				If [code]true[/code], the node will receive [constant NOTIFICATION_LOCAL_TRANSFORM_CHANGED] whenever [member transform] changes.

			<param index="0" name="enable" type="bool" />
			<description>
				If [code]true[/code], the node will receive [constant NOTIFICATION_TRANSFORM_CHANGED] whenever [member global_transform] changes.
				[b]Note:[/b] Most 3D nodes such as [VisualInstance3D] or [CollisionObject3D] automatically enable this to function correctly.

			<param index="2" name="transform" type="Transform3D" />
			<description>
				Selects the [param gizmo]'s subgizmo with the given [param id] and sets its transform. Only works in the editor.
				[b]Note:[/b] The gizmo object would typically be an instance of [EditorNode3DGizmo], but the argument type is kept generic to avoid creating a dependency on editor classes in [Node3D].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="show">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Allows this node to be rendered. Equivalent to setting [member visible] to [code]true[/code]. This is the opposite of [method hide].

			<description>
				Adds the given translation [param offset] to the node's position, in local space (relative to this node).
				[b]Note:[/b] Prefer using [method translate_object_local], instead, as this method may be changed in a future release.
				[b]Note:[/b] Despite the naming convention, this operation is [b]not[/b] calculated in parent space for compatibility reasons. To translate in parent space, add [param offset] to the [member position] ([code]node_3d.position += offset[/code]).
