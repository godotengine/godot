		LightmapperRD ("RD" stands for [RenderingDevice]) is the built-in GPU-based lightmapper for use with [LightmapGI]. On most dedicated GPUs, it can bake lightmaps much faster than most CPU-based lightmappers. LightmapperRD uses compute shaders to bake lightmaps, so it does not require CUDA or OpenCL libraries to be installed to be usable.
		[b]Note:[/b] This lightmapper requires the GPU to support the [RenderingDevice] backend (Forward+ and Mobile renderers). When using the Compatibility renderer, baking will use a temporary [RenderingDevice]. Support for [RenderingDevice] is not required to [i]render[/i] lightmaps that were already baked beforehand.
