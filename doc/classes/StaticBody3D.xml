	<description>
		A static 3D physics body. It can't be moved by external forces or contacts, but can be moved manually by other means such as code, [AnimationMixer]s (with [member AnimationMixer.callback_mode_process] set to [constant AnimationMixer.ANIMATION_CALLBACK_MODE_PROCESS_PHYSICS]), and [RemoteTransform3D].
		When [StaticBody3D] is moved, it is teleported to its new position without affecting other physics bodies in its path. If this is not desired, use [AnimatableBody3D] instead.
		[StaticBody3D] is useful for completely static objects like floors and walls, as well as moving surfaces like conveyor belts and circular revolving platforms (by using [member constant_linear_velocity] and [member constant_angular_velocity]).

		<member name="constant_angular_velocity" type="Vector3" setter="set_constant_angular_velocity" getter="get_constant_angular_velocity" default="Vector3(0, 0, 0)">
			The body's constant angular velocity. This does not rotate the body, but affects touching bodies, as if it were rotating.

		<member name="constant_linear_velocity" type="Vector3" setter="set_constant_linear_velocity" getter="get_constant_linear_velocity" default="Vector3(0, 0, 0)">
			The body's constant linear velocity. This does not move the body, but affects touching bodies, as if it were moving.

		<member name="physics_material_override" type="PhysicsMaterial" setter="set_physics_material_override" getter="get_physics_material_override">
			The physics material override for the body.
			If a material is assigned to this property, it will be used instead of any other physics material, such as an inherited one.
