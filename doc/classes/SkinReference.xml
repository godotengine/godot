	<brief_description>
		A reference-counted holder object for a skeleton RID used in the [RenderingServer].
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		An internal object containing a mapping from a [Skin] used within the context of a particular [MeshInstance3D] to refer to the skeleton's [RID] in the RenderingServer.
		See also [method MeshInstance3D.get_skin_reference] and [method RenderingServer.instance_attach_skeleton].
		Note that despite the similar naming, the skeleton RID used in the [RenderingServer] does not have a direct one-to-one correspondence to a [Skeleton3D] node.
		In particular, a [Skeleton3D] node with no [MeshInstance3D] children may be unknown to the [RenderingServer].
		On the other hand, a [Skeleton3D] with multiple [MeshInstance3D] nodes which each have different [member MeshInstance3D.skin] objects may have multiple SkinReference instances (and hence, multiple skeleton [RID]s).

	<methods>
		<method name="get_skeleton" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="RID" />
			<description>
				Returns the [RID] owned by this SkinReference, as returned by [method RenderingServer.skeleton_create].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_skin" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Skin" />
			<description>
				Returns the [Skin] connected to this SkinReference. In the case of [MeshInstance3D] with no [member MeshInstance3D.skin] assigned, this will reference an internal default [Skin] owned by that [MeshInstance3D].
				Note that a single [Skin] may have more than one [SkinReference] in the case that it is shared by meshes across multiple [Skeleton3D] nodes.
