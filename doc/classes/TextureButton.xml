	<brief_description>
		Texture-based button. Supports Pressed, Hover, Disabled and Focused states.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[TextureButton] has the same functionality as [Button], except it uses sprites instead of Godot's [Theme] resource. It is faster to create, but it doesn't support localization like more complex [Control]s.
		The "normal" state must contain a texture ([member texture_normal]); other textures are optional.
		See also [BaseButton] which contains common properties and methods associated with this node.

		<member name="expand" type="bool" setter="set_expand" getter="get_expand" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], the texture stretches to the edges of the node's bounding rectangle using the [member stretch_mode]. If [code]false[/code], the texture will not scale with the node.
		</member>
		<member name="flip_h" type="bool" setter="set_flip_h" getter="is_flipped_h" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], texture is flipped horizontally.
		</member>
		<member name="flip_v" type="bool" setter="set_flip_v" getter="is_flipped_v" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], texture is flipped vertically.
		</member>
		<member name="stretch_mode" type="int" setter="set_stretch_mode" getter="get_stretch_mode" enum="TextureButton.StretchMode" default="0">
			Controls the texture's behavior when you resize the node's bounding rectangle, [b]only if[/b] [member expand] is [code]true[/code]. Set it to one of the [enum StretchMode] constants. See the constants to learn more.
		</member>
		<member name="texture_click_mask" type="BitMap" setter="set_click_mask" getter="get_click_mask">
			Pure black and white [BitMap] image to use for click detection. On the mask, white pixels represent the button's clickable area. Use it to create buttons with curved shapes.
		</member>
		<member name="texture_disabled" type="Texture2D" setter="set_disabled_texture" getter="get_disabled_texture">
			Texture to display when the node is disabled. See [member BaseButton.disabled].
		</member>
		<member name="texture_focused" type="Texture2D" setter="set_focused_texture" getter="get_focused_texture">
			Texture to display when the node has mouse or keyboard focus. [member texture_focused] is displayed [i]over[/i] the base texture, so a partially transparent texture should be used to ensure the base texture remains visible. A texture that represents an outline or an underline works well for this purpose. To disable the focus visual effect, assign a fully transparent texture of any size. Note that disabling the focus visual effect will harm keyboard/controller navigation usability, so this is not recommended for accessibility reasons.
		</member>
		<member name="texture_hover" type="Texture2D" setter="set_hover_texture" getter="get_hover_texture">
			Texture to display when the mouse hovers the node.
		</member>
		<member name="texture_normal" type="Texture2D" setter="set_normal_texture" getter="get_normal_texture">
			Texture to display by default, when the node is [b]not[/b] in the disabled, focused, hover or pressed state.
		</member>
		<member name="texture_pressed" type="Texture2D" setter="set_pressed_texture" getter="get_pressed_texture">
			Texture to display on mouse down over the node, if the node has keyboard focus and the player presses the Enter key or if the player presses the [member BaseButton.shortcut] key.

		<constant name="STRETCH_SCALE" value="0" enum="StretchMode">

			Scale the texture to fit the node's bounding rectangle, but maintain the texture's aspect ratio.
