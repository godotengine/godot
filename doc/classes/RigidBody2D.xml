	<brief_description>
		A 2D physics body that is moved by a physics simulation.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[RigidBody2D] implements full 2D physics. It cannot be controlled directly, instead, you must apply forces to it (gravity, impulses, etc.), and the physics simulation will calculate the resulting movement, rotation, react to collisions, and affect other physics bodies in its path.
		The body's behavior can be adjusted via [member lock_rotation], [member freeze], and [member freeze_mode]. By changing various properties of the object, such as [member mass], you can control how the physics simulation acts on it.
		A rigid body will always maintain its shape and size, even when forces are applied to it. It is useful for objects that can be interacted with in an environment, such as a tree that can be knocked over or a stack of crates that can be pushed around.
		If you need to directly affect the body, prefer [method _integrate_forces] as it allows you to directly access the physics state.
		If you need to override the default physics behavior, you can write a custom force integration function. See [member custom_integrator].
		[b]Note:[/b] Changing the 2D transform or [member linear_velocity] of a [RigidBody2D] very often may lead to some unpredictable behaviors. This also happens when a [RigidBody2D] is the descendant of a constantly moving node, like another [RigidBody2D], as that will cause its global transform to be set whenever its ancestor moves.
		[b]Note:[/b] The physics engine in Godot is [b]not[/b] deterministic, the nature of physics engine determinism is very complex and has to do with many factors, and the physics is not guaranteed to run the same way for seemingly identical situations.

	<methods>
		<method name="_integrate_forces" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="state" type="PhysicsDirectBodyState2D" />
			<description>
				Called during physics processing, allowing you to read and safely modify the simulation state for the object. By default, it is called before the standard force integration, but the [member custom_integrator] property allows you to disable the standard force integration and do fully custom force integration for a body.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="add_constant_central_force">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="force" type="Vector2" />
			<description>
				Adds a constant directional force without affecting rotation that keeps being applied over time until cleared with [code]constant_force = Vector2(0, 0)[/code].
				This is equivalent to using [method add_constant_force] at the body's center of mass.
			</description>

			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="force" type="Vector2" />

			<description>
				Adds a constant positioned force to the body that keeps being applied over time until cleared with [code]constant_force = Vector2(0, 0)[/code].
				[param position] is the offset from the body origin in global coordinates.

		</method>
		<method name="apply_central_force">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="force" type="Vector2" />
			<description>
				Applies a directional force without affecting rotation. A force is time dependent and meant to be applied every physics update.

			<description>
				Applies a directional impulse without affecting rotation.
				An impulse is time-independent! Applying an impulse every frame would result in a framerate-dependent force. For this reason, it should only be used when simulating one-time impacts (use the "_force" functions otherwise).
				This is equivalent to using [method apply_impulse] at the body's center of mass.

			<description>
				Applies a rotational force without affecting position. A force is time dependent and meant to be applied every physics update.
				[b]Note:[/b] [member inertia] is required for this to work. To have [member inertia], an active [CollisionShape2D] must be a child of the node, or you can manually set [member inertia].

			<description>
				Returns the number of contacts this body has with other bodies. By default, this returns 0 unless bodies are configured to monitor contacts (see [member contact_monitor]).
				[b]Note:[/b] To retrieve the colliding bodies, use [method get_colliding_bodies].

		<method name="set_axis_velocity">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="axis_velocity" type="Vector2" />
			<description>
