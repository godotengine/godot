	<description>
		A real-time heightmap-shaped 3D particle collision shape affecting [GPUParticles3D] nodes.
		Heightmap shapes allow for efficiently representing collisions for convex and concave objects with a single "floor" (such as terrain). This is less flexible than [GPUParticlesCollisionSDF3D], but it doesn't require a baking step.
		[GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D] can also be regenerated in real-time when it is moved, when the camera moves, or even continuously. This makes [GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D] a good choice for weather effects such as rain and snow and games with highly dynamic geometry. However, this class is limited since heightmaps cannot represent overhangs (e.g. indoors or caves).
		[b]Note:[/b] [member ParticleProcessMaterial.collision_mode] must be [code]true[/code] on the [GPUParticles3D]'s process material for collision to work.
		[b]Note:[/b] Particle collision only affects [GPUParticles3D], not [CPUParticles3D].

			If [code]true[/code], the [GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D] will follow the current camera in global space. The [GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D] does not need to be a child of the [Camera3D] node for this to work.
			Following the camera has a performance cost, as it will force the heightmap to update whenever the camera moves. Consider lowering [member resolution] to improve performance if [member follow_camera_enabled] is [code]true[/code].
		</member>
		<member name="resolution" type="int" setter="set_resolution" getter="get_resolution" enum="GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D.Resolution" default="2">
			Higher resolutions can represent small details more accurately in large scenes, at the cost of lower performance. If [member update_mode] is [constant UPDATE_MODE_ALWAYS], consider using the lowest resolution possible.
		</member>
		<member name="size" type="Vector3" setter="set_size" getter="get_size" default="Vector3(2, 2, 2)">
			The collision heightmap's size in 3D units. To improve heightmap quality, [member size] should be set as small as possible while covering the parts of the scene you need.
		</member>
		<member name="update_mode" type="int" setter="set_update_mode" getter="get_update_mode" enum="GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D.UpdateMode" default="0">
			The update policy to use for the generated heightmap.

	<constants>
		<constant name="RESOLUTION_256" value="0" enum="Resolution">
			Generate a 256×256 heightmap. Intended for small-scale scenes, or larger scenes with no distant particles.
		</constant>
		<constant name="RESOLUTION_512" value="1" enum="Resolution">
			Generate a 512×512 heightmap. Intended for medium-scale scenes, or larger scenes with no distant particles.

		<constant name="RESOLUTION_1024" value="2" enum="Resolution">
			Generate a 1024×1024 heightmap. Intended for large scenes with distant particles.

		<constant name="RESOLUTION_2048" value="3" enum="Resolution">
			Generate a 2048×2048 heightmap. Intended for very large scenes with distant particles.
		</constant>
		<constant name="RESOLUTION_4096" value="4" enum="Resolution">
			Generate a 4096×4096 heightmap. Intended for huge scenes with distant particles.

			Generate a 8192×8192 heightmap. Intended for gigantic scenes with distant particles.

		<constant name="RESOLUTION_MAX" value="6" enum="Resolution">
			Represents the size of the [enum Resolution] enum.
		</constant>
		<constant name="UPDATE_MODE_WHEN_MOVED" value="0" enum="UpdateMode">
			Only update the heightmap when the [GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D] node is moved, or when the camera moves if [member follow_camera_enabled] is [code]true[/code]. An update can be forced by slightly moving the [GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D] in any direction, or by calling [method RenderingServer.particles_collision_height_field_update].
		</constant>
		<constant name="UPDATE_MODE_ALWAYS" value="1" enum="UpdateMode">
			Update the heightmap every frame. This has a significant performance cost. This update should only be used when geometry that particles can collide with changes significantly during gameplay.
