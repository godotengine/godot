	<brief_description>
		Exposes performance-related data.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This class provides access to a number of different monitors related to performance, such as memory usage, draw calls, and FPS. These are the same as the values displayed in the [b]Monitor[/b] tab in the editor's [b]Debugger[/b] panel. By using the [method get_monitor] method of this class, you can access this data from your code.
		You can add custom monitors using the [method add_custom_monitor] method. Custom monitors are available in [b]Monitor[/b] tab in the editor's [b]Debugger[/b] panel together with built-in monitors.
		[b]Note:[/b] Some of the built-in monitors are only available in debug mode and will always return [code]0[/code] when used in a project exported in release mode.
		[b]Note:[/b] Some of the built-in monitors are not updated in real-time for performance reasons, so there may be a delay of up to 1 second between changes.
		[b]Note:[/b] Custom monitors do not support negative values. Negative values are clamped to 0.

				Adds a custom monitor with the name [param id]. You can specify the category of the monitor using slash delimiters in [param id] (for example: [code]"Game/NumberOfNPCs"[/code]). If there is more than one slash delimiter, then the default category is used. The default category is [code]"Custom"[/code]. Prints an error if given [param id] is already present.
