	<brief_description>
		A button that shows some [Popup] when pressed.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[PopupButton] shows a designated [Popup]-derived node when it's pressed. It can be used to show menus or configuration panels.
		Note that by default no popup exists. Implement [method _create_popup] to create a popup when it's needed. Alternatively, the first [Popup] node added as a child of [PopupButton] will automatically be set as its own popup.
