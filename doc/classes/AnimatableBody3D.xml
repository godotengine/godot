	<description>
		An animatable 3D physics body. It can't be moved by external forces or contacts, but can be moved manually by other means such as code, [AnimationMixer]s (with [member AnimationMixer.callback_mode_process] set to [constant AnimationMixer.ANIMATION_CALLBACK_MODE_PROCESS_PHYSICS]), and [RemoteTransform3D].
		When [AnimatableBody3D] is moved, its linear and angular velocity are estimated and used to affect other physics bodies in its path. This makes it useful for moving platforms, doors, and other moving objects.
