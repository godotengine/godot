	<methods>
		<method name="play_scheduled">
			<return type="AudioStreamPlaybackScheduled" />
			<param index="0" name="absolute_time" type="float" />
			<param index="1" name="from_position" type="float" default="0.0" />
			<description>
				Schedules a sound to be played on the [AudioServer]'s timeline at [param absolute_time] in seconds. If the sound is scheduled to play earlier than the value returned by [method AudioServer.get_absolute_time], it will be played immediately. The sound starts from the given [param from_position] in seconds.
				Use this method for high precision playbacks, such as a metronome or other rhythm-based sounds.
				Returns an [AudioStreamPlaybackScheduled] instance representing the scheduled playback of the sound.
				[b]Note:[/b] Calling this method after [member AudioStreamPlayer2D.max_polyphony] is reached will cut off the oldest sound playing on this node.
				[b]Note:[/b] On the Web platform, [member AudioStreamPlayer2D.playback_type] must be set to [constant AudioServer.PLAYBACK_TYPE_STREAM]. Otherwise, this method will behave like [method AudioStreamPlayer2D.play].
