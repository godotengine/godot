		Node that represents collision shape data in 3D space.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Editor facility for creating and editing collision shapes in 3D space. You can use this node to represent all sorts of collision shapes, for example, add this to an [Area] to give it a detection shape, or add it to a [PhysicsBody] to give create solid object. [b]IMPORTANT[/b]: this is an Editor-only helper to create shapes, use [method get_shape] to get the actual shape.
