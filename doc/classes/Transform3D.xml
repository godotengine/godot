		A 3×4 matrix representing a 3D transformation.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The [Transform3D] built-in [Variant] type is a 3×4 matrix representing a transformation in 3D space. It contains a [Basis], which on its own can represent rotation, scale, and shear. Additionally, combined with its own [member origin], the transform can also represent a translation.
		For a general introduction, see the [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/math/matrices_and_transforms.html]Matrices and transforms[/url] tutorial.
		[b]Note:[/b] Godot uses a [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule]right-handed coordinate system[/url], which is a common standard. For directions, the convention for built-in types like [Camera3D] is for -Z to point forward (+X is right, +Y is up, and +Z is back). Other objects may use different direction conventions. For more information, see the [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/assets_pipeline/importing_scenes.html#d-asset-direction-conventions]Importing 3D Scenes[/url] tutorial.

		<constructor name="Transform3D">
			<return type="Transform3D" />
			<param index="0" name="from" type="Projection" />
			<description>
				Constructs a [Transform3D] from a [Projection]. Because [Transform3D] is a 3×4 matrix and [Projection] is a 4×4 matrix, this operation trims the last row of the projection matrix ([code]from.x.w[/code], [code]from.y.w[/code], [code]from.z.w[/code], and [code]from.w.w[/code] are not included in the new transform).

			<return type="Transform3D" />
			<param index="0" name="x_axis" type="Vector3" />
			<param index="1" name="y_axis" type="Vector3" />
			<param index="2" name="z_axis" type="Vector3" />
			<param index="3" name="origin" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Constructs a [Transform3D] from four [Vector3] values (also called matrix columns).
				The first three arguments are the [member basis]'s axes ([member Basis.x], [member Basis.y], and [member Basis.z]).

	<methods>
		<method name="affine_inverse" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Transform3D" />
			<description>
				Returns the inverted version of this transform. Unlike [method inverse], this method works with almost any [member basis], including non-uniform ones, but is slower. See also [method Basis.inverse].
				[b]Note:[/b] For this method to return correctly, the transform's [member basis] needs to have a determinant that is not exactly [code]0[/code] (see [method Basis.determinant]).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="interpolate_with" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Transform3D" />
			<param index="0" name="xform" type="Transform3D" />
			<param index="1" name="weight" type="float" />
			<description>
				Returns the result of the linear interpolation between this transform and [param xform] by the given [param weight].
				The [param weight] should be between [code]0.0[/code] and [code]1.0[/code] (inclusive). Values outside this range are allowed and can be used to perform [i]extrapolation[/i] instead.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="inverse" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Transform3D" />
			<description>
				Returns the inverted version of this transform. See also [method Basis.inverse].
				[b]Note:[/b] For this method to return correctly, the transform's [member basis] needs to be [i]orthonormal[/i] (see [method Basis.orthonormalized]). That means, the basis should only represent a rotation. If it does not, use [method affine_inverse] instead.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_equal_approx" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="xform" type="Transform3D" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if this transform and [param xform] are approximately equal, by running [method @GlobalScope.is_equal_approx] on each component.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_finite" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if this transform is finite, by calling [method @GlobalScope.is_finite] on each component.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="looking_at" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Transform3D" />
			<param index="0" name="target" type="Vector3" />
			<param index="1" name="up" type="Vector3" default="Vector3(0, 1, 0)" />
			<param index="2" name="use_model_front" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of this transform rotated so that the forward axis (-Z) points towards the [param target] position.
				The up axis (+Y) points as close to the [param up] vector as possible while staying perpendicular to the forward axis. The resulting transform is orthonormalized. The existing rotation, scale, and skew information from the original transform is discarded. The [param target] and [param up] vectors cannot be zero, cannot be parallel to each other, and are defined in global/parent space.
				If [param use_model_front] is [code]true[/code], the +Z axis (asset front) is treated as forward (implies +X is left) and points toward the [param target] position. By default, the -Z axis (camera forward) is treated as forward (implies +X is right).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="orthonormalized" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Transform3D" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of this transform with its [member basis] orthonormalized. An orthonormal basis is both [i]orthogonal[/i] (the axes are perpendicular to each other) and [i]normalized[/i] (the axes have a length of [code]1[/code]), which also means it can only represent rotation. See also [method Basis.orthonormalized].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="rotated" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Transform3D" />
			<param index="0" name="axis" type="Vector3" />
			<param index="1" name="angle" type="float" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of this transform rotated around the given [param axis] by the given [param angle] (in radians).
				The [param axis] must be a normalized vector.
				This method is an optimized version of multiplying the given transform [code]X[/code] with a corresponding rotation transform [code]R[/code] from the left, i.e., [code]R * X[/code].
				This can be seen as transforming with respect to the global/parent frame.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="rotated_local" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Transform3D" />
			<param index="0" name="axis" type="Vector3" />
			<param index="1" name="angle" type="float" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of this transform rotated around the given [param axis] by the given [param angle] (in radians).
				The [param axis] must be a normalized vector.
				This method is an optimized version of multiplying the given transform [code]X[/code] with a corresponding rotation transform [code]R[/code] from the right, i.e., [code]X * R[/code].
				This can be seen as transforming with respect to the local frame.
			</description>
		</method>

			<return type="Transform3D" />
			<param index="0" name="scale" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of this transform scaled by the given [param scale] factor.
				This method is an optimized version of multiplying the given transform [code]X[/code] with a corresponding scaling transform [code]S[/code] from the left, i.e., [code]S * X[/code].
				This can be seen as transforming with respect to the global/parent frame.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="scaled_local" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Transform3D" />
			<param index="0" name="scale" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of this transform scaled by the given [param scale] factor.
				This method is an optimized version of multiplying the given transform [code]X[/code] with a corresponding scaling transform [code]S[/code] from the right, i.e., [code]X * S[/code].
				This can be seen as transforming with respect to the local frame.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="translated" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Transform3D" />
			<param index="0" name="offset" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of this transform translated by the given [param offset].
				This method is an optimized version of multiplying the given transform [code]X[/code] with a corresponding translation transform [code]T[/code] from the left, i.e., [code]T * X[/code].
				This can be seen as transforming with respect to the global/parent frame.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="translated_local" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Transform3D" />
			<param index="0" name="offset" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of this transform translated by the given [param offset].
				This method is an optimized version of multiplying the given transform [code]X[/code] with a corresponding translation transform [code]T[/code] from the right, i.e., [code]X * T[/code].
				This can be seen as transforming with respect to the local frame.
