	<brief_description>
		Overrides the location sounds are heard from.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Once added to the scene tree and enabled using [method make_current], this node will override the location sounds are heard from. This can be used to listen from a location different from the [Camera3D].

	<methods>
		<method name="clear_current">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Disables the listener to use the current camera's listener instead.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_listener_transform" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Transform3D" />
			<description>
				Returns the listener's global orthonormalized [Transform3D].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_current" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the listener was made current using [method make_current], [code]false[/code] otherwise.
				[b]Note:[/b] There may be more than one AudioListener3D marked as "current" in the scene tree, but only the one that was made current last will be used.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="make_current">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Enables the listener. This will override the current camera's listener.
