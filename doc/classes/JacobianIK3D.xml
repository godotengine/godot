	<brief_description>
		Pseudo inverse Jacobian matrix based inverse kinematics solver.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[JacobianIK3D] calculates rotations for all joints simultaneously, producing natural and smooth movements. It is particularly suited for biological animations.
		The result twist around forward vector will always be kept from previous pose.
		[b]Note:[/b] It converges more slowly than other IK solvers, leading to gentler and less immediate tracking of targets.
