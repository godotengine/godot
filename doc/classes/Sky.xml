			The [Sky]'s radiance map size. The higher the radiance map size, the more detailed the lighting from the [Sky] will be.
			See [enum RadianceSize] constants for values.
			[b]Note:[/b] You will only benefit from high radiance sizes if you have perfectly sharp reflective surfaces in your project and are not using [ReflectionProbe]s or [GIProbe]s. For most projects, keeping [member radiance_size] to the default value is the best compromise between visuals and performance. Be careful when using high radiance size values as these can cause crashes on low-end GPUs.
