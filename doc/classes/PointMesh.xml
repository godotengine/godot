		Mesh with a single point primitive.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A [PointMesh] is a primitive mesh composed of a single point. Instead of relying on triangles, points are rendered as a single rectangle on the screen with a constant size. They are intended to be used with particle systems, but can also be used as a cheap way to render billboarded sprites (for example in a point cloud).
		In order to be displayed, point meshes must be used with a material that has a point size. The point size can be accessed in a shader with the [code]POINT_SIZE[/code] built-in, or in a [BaseMaterial3D] by setting the [member BaseMaterial3D.use_point_size] and [member BaseMaterial3D.point_size] properties.
		[b]Note:[/b] When using point meshes, properties that normally affect vertices will be ignored, including [member BaseMaterial3D.billboard_mode], [member BaseMaterial3D.grow], and [member BaseMaterial3D.cull_mode].
