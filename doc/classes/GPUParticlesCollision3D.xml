	<brief_description>
		Abstract base class for 3D particle collision shapes affecting [GPUParticles3D] nodes.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Particle collision shapes can be used to make particles stop or bounce against them.
		Particle collision shapes work in real-time and can be moved, rotated and scaled during gameplay. Unlike attractors, non-uniform scaling of collision shapes is [i]not[/i] supported.
		Particle collision shapes can be temporarily disabled by hiding them.
		[b]Note:[/b] [member ParticleProcessMaterial.collision_mode] must be [constant ParticleProcessMaterial.COLLISION_RIGID] or [constant ParticleProcessMaterial.COLLISION_HIDE_ON_CONTACT] on the [GPUParticles3D]'s process material for collision to work.
		[b]Note:[/b] Particle collision only affects [GPUParticles3D], not [CPUParticles3D].
		[b]Note:[/b] Particles pushed by a collider that is being moved will not be interpolated, which can result in visible stuttering. This can be alleviated by setting [member GPUParticles3D.fixed_fps] to [code]0[/code] or a value that matches or exceeds the target framerate.

		<member name="collision_layer" type="int" setter="set_collision_layer" getter="get_collision_layer" default="1">
			The particle collision layers that this collision shape belongs to. In the [GPUParticles3D] node, set ([member GPUParticles3D.collision_mask]) to determine which collision layers should affect it.
			After configuring collision layers the collision shapes, specific layers can be unchecked in the collision mask of certain particles to prevent them from being affected by the collision shapes in these layers. For example, this can be used if you're using a collision shape to block certain spell effects but don't want the collision to affect unrelated weather particles at the same position.
			Particle collision can also be disabled on a per-process material basis by setting [member ParticleProcessMaterial.attractor_interaction_enabled] on the [GPUParticles3D] node.
