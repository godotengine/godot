		Utility class which holds a reference to the internal identifier of an [Object] instance, as given by [method Object.get_instance_id]. This ID can then be used to retrieve the object instance with [method @GlobalScope.instance_from_id].
		This class is used internally by the editor inspector and script debugger, but can also be used in plugins to pass and display objects as their IDs.
