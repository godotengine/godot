		An array of [Cubemap]s, stored together and with a single reference.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[CubemapArray]s are made of an array of [Cubemap]s. Like [Cubemap]s, they are made of multiple textures, the amount of which must be divisible by 6 (one for each face of the cube).
		The primary benefit of [CubemapArray]s is that they can be accessed in shader code using a single texture reference. In other words, you can pass multiple [Cubemap]s into a shader using a single [CubemapArray]. [Cubemap]s are allocated in adjacent cache regions on the GPU, which makes [CubemapArray]s the most efficient way to store multiple [Cubemap]s.
		[b]Note:[/b] Godot uses [CubemapArray]s internally for many effects, including the [Sky] if you set [member ProjectSettings.rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/texture_array_reflections] to [code]true[/code]. To create such a texture file yourself, reimport your image files using the import presets of the File System dock.
		[b]Note:[/b] [CubemapArray] is not supported in the Compatibility renderer.
