		An array of [Cubemap]s, stored together and with a single reference.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[CubemapArray]s are made of an array of [Cubemap]s. Like [Cubemap]s, they are made of multiple textures, the amount of which must be divisible by 6 (one for each face of the cube).
		The primary benefit of [CubemapArray]s is that they can be accessed in shader code using a single texture reference. In other words, you can pass multiple [Cubemap]s into a shader using a single [CubemapArray]. [Cubemap]s are allocated in adjacent cache regions on the GPU, which makes [CubemapArray]s the most efficient way to store multiple [Cubemap]s.
		Godot uses [CubemapArray]s internally for many effects, including the [Sky] if you set [member ProjectSettings.rendering/reflections/sky_reflections/texture_array_reflections] to [code]true[/code].
		To create such a texture file yourself, reimport your image files using the Godot Editor import presets. To create a CubemapArray from code, use [method ImageTextureLayered.create_from_images] on an instance of the CubemapArray class.
		The expected image order is X+, X-, Y+, Y-, Z+, Z- (in Godot's coordinate system, so Y+ is "up" and Z- is "forward"). You can use one of the following templates as a base:
		- [url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-docs/master/tutorials/assets_pipeline/img/cubemap_template_2x3.webp]2×3 cubemap template (default layout option)[/url]
		- [url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-docs/master/tutorials/assets_pipeline/img/cubemap_template_3x2.webp]3×2 cubemap template[/url]
		- [url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-docs/master/tutorials/assets_pipeline/img/cubemap_template_1x6.webp]1×6 cubemap template[/url]
		- [url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-docs/master/tutorials/assets_pipeline/img/cubemap_template_6x1.webp]6×1 cubemap template[/url]
		Multiple layers are stacked on top of each other when using the default vertical import option (with the first layer at the top). Alternatively, you can choose a horizontal layout in the import options (with the first layer at the left).
		[b]Note:[/b] [CubemapArray] is not supported in the Compatibility renderer due to graphics API limitations.
