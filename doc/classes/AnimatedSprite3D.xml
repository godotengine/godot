	<brief_description>
		2D sprite node in 3D world, that can use multiple 2D textures for animation.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[AnimatedSprite3D] is similar to the [Sprite3D] node, except it carries multiple textures as animation [member frames]. Animations are created using a [SpriteFrames] resource, which allows you to import image files (or a folder containing said files) to provide the animation frames for the sprite. The [SpriteFrames] resource can be configured in the editor via the SpriteFrames bottom panel.
		After setting up [member frames], [method play] may be called. It's also possible to select an [member animation] and toggle [member playing], even within the editor.
		To pause the current animation, set [member playing] to [code]false[/code]. Alternatively, setting [member speed_scale] to [code]0[/code] also preserves the current frame's elapsed time.

		<method name="play">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="anim" type="StringName" default="&amp;&quot;&quot;" />
			<param index="1" name="backwards" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Plays the animation named [param anim]. If no [param anim] is provided, the current animation is played. If [param backwards] is [code]true[/code], the animation is played in reverse.
				[b]Note:[/b] If [member speed_scale] is negative, the animation direction specified by [param backwards] will be inverted.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="stop">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Stops the current [member animation] at the current [member frame].
				[b]Note:[/b] This method resets the current frame's elapsed time and removes the [code]backwards[/code] flag from the current [member animation] (if it was previously set by [method play]). If this behavior is undesired, set [member playing] to [code]false[/code] instead.

	<members>
		<member name="animation" type="StringName" setter="set_animation" getter="get_animation" default="&amp;&quot;default&quot;">
			The current animation from the [code]frames[/code] resource. If this value changes, the [code]frame[/code] counter is reset.

		<member name="frame" type="int" setter="set_frame" getter="get_frame" default="0">
			The displayed animation frame's index.

			If [code]true[/code], the [member animation] is currently playing. Setting this property to [code]false[/code] pauses the current animation. Use [method stop] to stop the animation at the current frame instead.
			[b]Note:[/b] Unlike [method stop], changing this property to [code]false[/code] preserves the current frame's elapsed time and the [code]backwards[/code] flag of the current [member animation] (if it was previously set by [method play]).
			[b]Note:[/b] After a non-looping animation finishes, the property still remains [code]true[/code].

		<member name="speed_scale" type="float" setter="set_speed_scale" getter="get_speed_scale" default="1.0">
			The animation speed is multiplied by this value. If set to a negative value, the animation is played in reverse. If set to [code]0[/code], the animation is paused, preserving the current frame's elapsed time.

				Emitted when the animation reaches the end, or the start if it is played in reverse. If the animation is looping, this signal is emitted at the end of each loop.
