		A region of the 2D navigation map.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A region of the navigation map. It tells the [NavigationServer2D] what can be navigated and what cannot, based on its [NavigationPolygon] resource.
		Two regions can be connected to each other if they share a similar edge. You can set the minimum distance between two vertices required to connect two edges by using [method NavigationServer2D.map_set_edge_connection_margin].
		[b]Note:[/b] Overlapping two regions' polygons is not enough for connecting two regions. They must share a similar edge.
