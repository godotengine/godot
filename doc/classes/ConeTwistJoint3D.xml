	<description>
		A physics joint that connects two 3D physics bodies in a way that simulates a ball-and-socket joint. The twist axis is initiated as the X axis of the [ConeTwistJoint3D]. Once the physics bodies swing, the twist axis is calculated as the middle of the X axes of the joint in the local space of the two physics bodies. Useful for limbs like shoulders and hips, lamps hanging off a ceiling, etc.
