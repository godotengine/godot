	<description>
		A physics joint that connects two 3D physics bodies in a way that simulates a ball-and-socket joint. The twist axis is initiated as the X axis of the [ConeTwistJoint3D]. Once the physics bodies swing, the twist axis is calculated as the middle of the X axes of the joint in the local space of the two physics bodies. Useful for limbs like shoulders and hips, lamps hanging off a ceiling, etc.

		<member name="bias" type="float" setter="set_param" getter="get_param" default="0.3">
			The speed with which the swing or twist will take place.
			The higher, the faster.
		</member>
		<member name="relaxation" type="float" setter="set_param" getter="get_param" default="1.0">
			The amount of relaxation, or inverse damping, applied to angular velocity when rotated beyond the swing span and/or twist span. It is measured in rad/N/m/s, or rad·s/kg/m² in SI base units. Unlike most joints in Godot which use damping, [ConeTwistJoint3D] uses inverse damping (relaxation), so higher values result in less damping and lower values result in more damping.
			Higher relaxation values make the joint more elastic or bouncy. Lower values result in a smoother, more gradual reduction in swing and twist speed difference velocity, preventing oscillations or rapid rotation as the joint returns to its span limits.
		</member>
		<member name="softness" type="float" setter="set_param" getter="get_param" default="0.8">
			The stiffness factor applied to rotation beyond the swing span and twist span limits. It is measured in N·m/rad, or kg·m²/s²/rad in SI base units.
			Higher angular stiffness results in a harder limit, which more strongly resists rotation beyond the limit. Lower values make the limit softer and more flexible.

		<member name="swing_span" type="float" setter="set_param" getter="get_param" default="0.7853982">
			Swing is rotation from side to side, around the axis perpendicular to the twist axis.
			The swing span defines, how much rotation will not get corrected along the swing axis.
			Could be defined as looseness in the [ConeTwistJoint3D].
			If below 0.05, this behavior is locked.
