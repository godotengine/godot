	<brief_description>
		A twist joint between two 3D PhysicsBodies.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The joint can rotate the bodies across an axis defined by the local x-axes of the [Joint3D].
		The twist axis is initiated as the X axis of the [Joint3D].
		Once the Bodies swing, the twist axis is calculated as the middle of the x-axes of the Joint3D in the local space of the two Bodies. See also [Generic6DOFJoint3D].
