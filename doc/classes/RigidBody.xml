	<brief_description>
		Physics Body whose position is determined through physics simulation in 3D space.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This is the node that implements full 3D physics. This means that you do not control a RigidBody directly. Instead you can apply forces to it (gravity, impulses, etc.), and the physics simulation will calculate the resulting movement, collision, bouncing, rotating, etc.
		This node can use custom force integration, for writing complex physics motion behavior per node.
		This node can shift state between regular Rigid body, Kinematic, Character or Static.
		Character mode forbids this node from being rotated.
		As a warning, don't change RigidBody's position every frame or very often. Sporadic changes work fine, but physics runs at a different granularity (fixed hz) than usual rendering (process callback) and maybe even in a separate thread, so changing this from a process loop will yield strange behavior.

		<method name="_integrate_forces" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void">
			</return>
			<argument index="0" name="state" type="PhysicsDirectBodyState">
			</argument>
			<description>
				Called during physics processing, allowing you to read and safely modify the simulation state for the object. By default it works in addition to the usual physics behavior, but [method set_use_custom_integrator] allows you to disable the default behavior and do fully custom force integration for a body.

		<method name="apply_impulse">
			<return type="void">
			</return>
			<argument index="0" name="position" type="Vector3">
			</argument>
			<argument index="1" name="impulse" type="Vector3">
			</argument>
			<description>
				Apply a positioned impulse (which will be affected by the body mass and shape). This is the equivalent of hitting a billiard ball with a cue: a force that is applied once, and only once. Both the impulse and the offset from the body origin are in global coordinates.

		<method name="get_colliding_bodies" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Array">
			</return>
			<description>
				Return a list of the bodies colliding with this one. By default, number of max contacts reported is at 0 , see [method set_max_contacts_reported] to increase it.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_axis_velocity">
			<return type="void">
			</return>
			<argument index="0" name="axis_velocity" type="Vector3">
			</argument>
			<description>
				Set an axis velocity. The velocity in the given vector axis will be set as the given vector length. This is useful for jumping behavior.

		<member name="can_sleep" type="bool" setter="set_can_sleep" getter="is_able_to_sleep">
			If [code]true[/code] the RigidBody will not calculate forces and will act as a static body while there is no movement. It will wake up when forces are applied through other collisions or when the [code]apply_impulse[/code] method is used.
		</member>
		<member name="contact_monitor" type="bool" setter="set_contact_monitor" getter="is_contact_monitor_enabled">
			If true, the RigidBody will emit signals when it collides with another RigidBody.
		</member>
		<member name="contacts_reported" type="int" setter="set_max_contacts_reported" getter="get_max_contacts_reported">
			The maximum contacts to report. Bodies can keep a log of the contacts with other bodies, this is enabled by setting the maximum amount of contacts reported to a number greater than 0.
		</member>
		<member name="continuous_cd" type="bool" setter="set_use_continuous_collision_detection" getter="is_using_continuous_collision_detection">
			If [code]true[/code] continuous collision detection is used.
			Continuous collision detection tries to predict where a moving body will collide, instead of moving it and correcting its movement if it collided. Continuous collision detection is more precise, and misses less impacts by small, fast-moving objects. Not using continuous collision detection is faster to compute, but can miss small, fast-moving objects.

		<member name="custom_integrator" type="bool" setter="set_use_custom_integrator" getter="is_using_custom_integrator">
			If [code]true[/code] internal force integration will be disabled (like gravity or air friction) for this body. Other than collision response, the body will only move as determined by the [method _integrate_forces] function, if defined.

		<member name="friction" type="float" setter="set_friction" getter="get_friction">
			The body friction, from 0 (frictionless) to 1 (max friction).

		<member name="gravity_scale" type="float" setter="set_gravity_scale" getter="get_gravity_scale">
			This is multiplied by the global 3D gravity setting found in "Project &gt; Project Settings &gt; Physics &gt; 3d" to produce RigidBody's gravity. E.g. a value of 1 will be normal gravity, 2 will apply double gravity, and 0.5 will apply half gravity to this object.

		<member name="linear_damp" type="float" setter="set_linear_damp" getter="get_linear_damp">
			RigidBody's linear damp. Default value: -1, cannot be less than -1. If this value is different from -1, any linear damp derived from the world or areas will be overridden.
		</member>
		<member name="linear_velocity" type="Vector3" setter="set_linear_velocity" getter="get_linear_velocity">
			RigidBody's linear velocity. Can be used sporadically, but [b]DON'T SET THIS IN EVERY FRAME[/b], because physics may run in another thread and runs at a different granularity. Use [method _integrate_forces] as your process loop for precise control of the body state.

		<member name="sleeping" type="bool" setter="set_sleeping" getter="is_sleeping">
			If [code]true[/code] RigidBody is sleeping and will not calculate forces until woken up by a collision or the [code]apply_impulse[/code] method.

			RigidBody's weight based on its mass and the global 3D gravity. Global values are set in "Project &gt; Project Settings &gt; Physics &gt; 3d".
