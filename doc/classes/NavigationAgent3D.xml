		A 3D agent used to pathfind to a position while avoiding obstacles.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A 3D agent used to pathfind to a position while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles. The calculation can be used by the parent node to dynamically move it along the path. Requires navigation data to work correctly.
		Dynamic obstacles are avoided using RVO collision avoidance. Avoidance is computed before physics, so the pathfinding information can be used safely in the physics step.
		[b]Note:[/b] After setting the [member target_position] property, the [method get_next_path_position] method must be used once every physics frame to update the internal path logic of the navigation agent. The vector position it returns should be used as the next movement position for the agent's parent node.
		[b]Note:[/b] Several methods of this class, such as [method get_next_path_position], can trigger a new path calculation. Calling these in your callback to an agent's signal, such as [signal waypoint_reached], can cause infinite recursion. It is recommended to call these methods in the physics step or, alternatively, delay their call until the end of the frame (see [method Object.call_deferred] or [constant Object.CONNECT_DEFERRED]).

	<methods>
		<method name="distance_to_target" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="float" />
			<description>
				Returns the distance to the target position, using the agent's global position. The user must set [member target_position] in order for this to be accurate.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_avoidance_layer_value" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="layer_number" type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns whether or not the specified layer of the [member avoidance_layers] bitmask is enabled, given a [param layer_number] between 1 and 32.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_avoidance_mask_value" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="mask_number" type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns whether or not the specified mask of the [member avoidance_mask] bitmask is enabled, given a [param mask_number] between 1 and 32.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_current_navigation_path" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="PackedVector3Array" />
			<description>
				Returns this agent's current path from start to finish in global coordinates. The path only updates when the target position is changed or the agent requires a repath. The path array is not intended to be used in direct path movement as the agent has its own internal path logic that would get corrupted by changing the path array manually. Use the intended [method get_next_path_position] once every physics frame to receive the next path point for the agents movement as this function also updates the internal path logic.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_current_navigation_path_index" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns which index the agent is currently on in the navigation path's [PackedVector3Array].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_current_navigation_result" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="NavigationPathQueryResult3D" />
			<description>
				Returns the path query result for the path the agent is currently following.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_final_position">
			<return type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Returns the reachable final position of the current navigation path in global coordinates. This position can change if the agent needs to update the navigation path which makes the agent emit the [signal path_changed] signal.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_navigation_layer_value" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="layer_number" type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns whether or not the specified layer of the [member navigation_layers] bitmask is enabled, given a [param layer_number] between 1 and 32.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_navigation_map" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="RID" />
			<description>
				Returns the [RID] of the navigation map for this NavigationAgent node. This function returns always the map set on the NavigationAgent node and not the map of the abstract agent on the NavigationServer. If the agent map is changed directly with the NavigationServer API the NavigationAgent node will not be aware of the map change. Use [method set_navigation_map] to change the navigation map for the NavigationAgent and also update the agent on the NavigationServer.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_next_path_position">
			<return type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Returns the next position in global coordinates that can be moved to, making sure that there are no static objects in the way. If the agent does not have a navigation path, it will return the position of the agent's parent. The use of this function once every physics frame is required to update the internal path logic of the NavigationAgent.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_path_length" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="float" />
			<description>
				Returns the length of the currently calculated path. The returned value is [code]0.0[/code], if the path is still calculating or no calculation has been requested yet.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_rid" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="RID" />
			<description>
				Returns the [RID] of this agent on the [NavigationServer3D].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_navigation_finished">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the agent's navigation has finished. If the target is reachable, navigation ends when the target is reached. If the target is unreachable, navigation ends when the last waypoint of the path is reached.
				[b]Note:[/b] While [code]true[/code] prefer to stop calling update functions like [method get_next_path_position]. This avoids jittering the standing agent due to calling repeated path updates.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_target_reachable">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if [method get_final_position] is within [member target_desired_distance] of the [member target_position].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_target_reached" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the agent reached the target, i.e. the agent moved within [member target_desired_distance] of the [member target_position]. It may not always be possible to reach the target but it should always be possible to reach the final position. See [method get_final_position].
			</description>

		<method name="set_avoidance_layer_value">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="layer_number" type="int" />
			<param index="1" name="value" type="bool" />
			<description>
				Based on [param value], enables or disables the specified layer in the [member avoidance_layers] bitmask, given a [param layer_number] between 1 and 32.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_avoidance_mask_value">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="mask_number" type="int" />
			<param index="1" name="value" type="bool" />
			<description>
				Based on [param value], enables or disables the specified mask in the [member avoidance_mask] bitmask, given a [param mask_number] between 1 and 32.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_navigation_layer_value">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="layer_number" type="int" />
			<param index="1" name="value" type="bool" />
			<description>
				Based on [param value], enables or disables the specified layer in the [member navigation_layers] bitmask, given a [param layer_number] between 1 and 32.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_navigation_map">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="navigation_map" type="RID" />
			<description>
				Sets the [RID] of the navigation map this NavigationAgent node should use and also updates the [code]agent[/code] on the NavigationServer.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_velocity_forced">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="velocity" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Replaces the internal velocity in the collision avoidance simulation with [param velocity]. When an agent is teleported to a new position this function should be used in the same frame. If called frequently this function can get agents stuck.

When [member velocity] is set and the processing is completed a [code]safe_velocity[/code] Vector3 is received with a signal connection to [signal velocity_computed]. Avoidance processing with many registered agents has a significant performance cost and should only be enabled on agents that currently require it.

			The agent does not adjust the velocity for other agents that would match the [member avoidance_mask] but have a lower [member avoidance_priority]. This in turn makes the other agents with lower priority adjust their velocities even more to avoid collision with this agent.

			If [code]true[/code] shows debug visuals for this agent.

		<member name="height" type="float" setter="set_height" getter="get_height" default="1.0">
			The height of the avoidance agent. Agents will ignore other agents or obstacles that are above or below their current position + height in 2D avoidance. Does nothing in 3D avoidance which uses radius spheres alone.
		</member>
		<member name="keep_y_velocity" type="bool" setter="set_keep_y_velocity" getter="get_keep_y_velocity" default="true">
			If [code]true[/code], and the agent uses 2D avoidance, it will remember the set y-axis velocity and reapply it after the avoidance step. While 2D avoidance has no y-axis and simulates on a flat plane this setting can help to soften the most obvious clipping on uneven 3D geometry.

			The distance to search for other agents.
		</member>
		<member name="path_desired_distance" type="float" setter="set_path_desired_distance" getter="get_path_desired_distance" default="1.0">
			The distance threshold before a path point is considered to be reached. This allows agents to not have to hit a path point on the path exactly, but only to reach its general area. If this value is set too high, the NavigationAgent will skip points on the path, which can lead to it leaving the navigation mesh. If this value is set too low, the NavigationAgent will be stuck in a repath loop because it will constantly overshoot the distance to the next point on each physics frame update.
		</member>
		<member name="path_height_offset" type="float" setter="set_path_height_offset" getter="get_path_height_offset" default="0.0">
			The height offset is subtracted from the y-axis value of any vector path position for this NavigationAgent. The NavigationAgent height offset does not change or influence the navigation mesh or pathfinding query result. Additional navigation maps that use regions with navigation meshes that the developer baked with appropriate agent radius or height values are required to support different-sized agents.

		</member>
		<member name="path_return_max_radius" type="float" setter="set_path_return_max_radius" getter="get_path_return_max_radius" default="0.0">
			The maximum allowed radius in world units that the returned path can be from the path start. The path will be clipped when going over this radius. Compared to [member path_return_max_length], this allows the agent to go that much further, if they need to walk around a corner.
			[b]Note:[/b] This will perform a sphere clip considering only the actual navigation mesh path points with the first path position being the sphere's center.

			The maximum distance a searched polygon can be away from the start polygon before the pathfinding cancels the search for a path to the (possibly unreachable or very far away) target position polygon. In this case the pathfinding resets and builds a path from the start polygon to the polygon that was found closest to the target position so far. A value of [code]0[/code] or below counts as unlimited. In case of unlimited the pathfinding will search all polygons connected with the start polygon until either the target position polygon is found or all available polygon search options are exhausted.

		<member name="radius" type="float" setter="set_radius" getter="get_radius" default="0.5">
			The radius of the avoidance agent. This is the "body" of the avoidance agent and not the avoidance maneuver starting radius (which is controlled by [member neighbor_distance]).
			Does not affect normal pathfinding. To change an actor's pathfinding radius bake [NavigationMesh] resources with a different [member NavigationMesh.agent_radius] property and use different navigation maps for each actor size.

			If [code]true[/code] a simplified version of the path will be returned with less critical path points removed. The simplification amount is controlled by [member simplify_epsilon]. The simplification uses a variant of Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm for curve point decimation.
			Path simplification can be helpful to mitigate various path following issues that can arise with certain agent types and script behaviors. E.g. "steering" agents or avoidance in "open fields".
		</member>
		<member name="target_desired_distance" type="float" setter="set_target_desired_distance" getter="get_target_desired_distance" default="1.0">
			The distance threshold before the target is considered to be reached. On reaching the target, [signal target_reached] is emitted and navigation ends (see [method is_navigation_finished] and [signal navigation_finished]).
			You can make navigation end early by setting this property to a value greater than [member path_desired_distance] (navigation will end before reaching the last waypoint).
			You can also make navigation end closer to the target than each individual path position by setting this property to a value lower than [member path_desired_distance] (navigation won't immediately end when reaching the last waypoint). However, if the value set is too low, the agent will be stuck in a repath loop because it will constantly overshoot the distance to the target on each physics frame update.

Must be positive.

		<member name="use_3d_avoidance" type="bool" setter="set_use_3d_avoidance" getter="get_use_3d_avoidance" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], the agent calculates avoidance velocities in 3D omnidirectionally, e.g. for games that take place in air, underwater or space. Agents using 3D avoidance only avoid other agents using 3D avoidance, and react to radius-based avoidance obstacles. They ignore any vertex-based obstacles.
			If [code]false[/code], the agent calculates avoidance velocities in 2D along the x and z-axes, ignoring the y-axis. Agents using 2D avoidance only avoid other agents using 2D avoidance, and react to radius-based avoidance obstacles or vertex-based avoidance obstacles. Other agents using 2D avoidance that are below or above their current position including [member height] are ignored.

			Sets the new wanted velocity for the agent. The avoidance simulation will try to fulfill this velocity if possible but will modify it to avoid collision with other agents and obstacles.
