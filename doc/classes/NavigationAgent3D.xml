		A 3D agent used to pathfind to a position while avoiding obstacles.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A 3D agent used to pathfind to a position while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles. The calculation can be used by the parent node to dynamically move it along the path. Requires navigation data to work correctly.
		Dynamic obstacles are avoided using RVO collision avoidance. Avoidance is computed before physics, so the pathfinding information can be used safely in the physics step.
		[b]Note:[/b] After setting the [member target_position] property, the [method get_next_path_position] method must be used once every physics frame to update the internal path logic of the navigation agent. The vector position it returns should be used as the next movement position for the agent's parent node.

	<methods>
		<method name="distance_to_target" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="float" />
			<description>
				Returns the distance to the target position, using the agent's global position. The user must set [member target_position] in order for this to be accurate.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_avoidance_layer_value" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="layer_number" type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns whether or not the specified layer of the [member avoidance_layers] bitmask is enabled, given a [param layer_number] between 1 and 32.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_avoidance_mask_value" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="mask_number" type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns whether or not the specified mask of the [member avoidance_mask] bitmask is enabled, given a [param mask_number] between 1 and 32.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_current_navigation_path" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="PackedVector3Array" />
			<description>
				Returns this agent's current path from start to finish in global coordinates. The path only updates when the target position is changed or the agent requires a repath. The path array is not intended to be used in direct path movement as the agent has its own internal path logic that would get corrupted by changing the path array manually. Use the intended [method get_next_path_position] once every physics frame to receive the next path point for the agents movement as this function also updates the internal path logic.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_current_navigation_path_index" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns which index the agent is currently on in the navigation path's [PackedVector3Array].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_current_navigation_result" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="NavigationPathQueryResult3D" />
			<description>
				Returns the path query result for the path the agent is currently following.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_final_position">
			<return type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Returns the reachable final position of the current navigation path in global coordinates. This position can change if the agent needs to update the navigation path which makes the agent emit the [signal path_changed] signal.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_navigation_layer_value" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="layer_number" type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns whether or not the specified layer of the [member navigation_layers] bitmask is enabled, given a [param layer_number] between 1 and 32.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_navigation_map" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="RID" />
			<description>
				Returns the [RID] of the navigation map for this NavigationAgent node. This function returns always the map set on the NavigationAgent node and not the map of the abstract agent on the NavigationServer. If the agent map is changed directly with the NavigationServer API the NavigationAgent node will not be aware of the map change. Use [method set_navigation_map] to change the navigation map for the NavigationAgent and also update the agent on the NavigationServer.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_next_path_position">
			<return type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Returns the next position in global coordinates that can be moved to, making sure that there are no static objects in the way. If the agent does not have a navigation path, it will return the position of the agent's parent. The use of this function once every physics frame is required to update the internal path logic of the NavigationAgent.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_rid" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="RID" />
			<description>
				Returns the [RID] of this agent on the [NavigationServer3D].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_navigation_finished">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the end of the currently loaded navigation path has been reached.
				[b]Note:[/b] While true prefer to stop calling update functions like [method get_next_path_position]. This avoids jittering the standing agent due to calling repeated path updates.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_target_reachable">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if [method get_final_position] is within [member target_desired_distance] of the [member target_position].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_target_reached" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns true if [member target_position] is reached. It may not always be possible to reach the target position. It should always be possible to reach the final position though. See [method get_final_position].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_avoidance_layer_value">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="layer_number" type="int" />
			<param index="1" name="value" type="bool" />
			<description>
				Based on [param value], enables or disables the specified layer in the [member avoidance_layers] bitmask, given a [param layer_number] between 1 and 32.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_avoidance_mask_value">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="mask_number" type="int" />
			<param index="1" name="value" type="bool" />
			<description>
				Based on [param value], enables or disables the specified mask in the [member avoidance_mask] bitmask, given a [param mask_number] between 1 and 32.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_navigation_layer_value">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="layer_number" type="int" />
			<param index="1" name="value" type="bool" />
			<description>
				Based on [param value], enables or disables the specified layer in the [member navigation_layers] bitmask, given a [param layer_number] between 1 and 32.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_navigation_map">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="navigation_map" type="RID" />
			<description>
				Sets the [RID] of the navigation map this NavigationAgent node should use and also updates the [code]agent[/code] on the NavigationServer.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_velocity_forced">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="velocity" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Replaces the internal velocity in the collision avoidance simulation with [param velocity]. When an agent is teleported to a new position this function should be used in the same frame. If called frequently this function can get agents stuck.

			If [code]true[/code] the agent is registered for an RVO avoidance callback on the [NavigationServer3D]. When [member velocity] is set and the processing is completed a [code]safe_velocity[/code] Vector3 is received with a signal connection to [signal velocity_computed]. Avoidance processing with many registered agents has a significant performance cost and should only be enabled on agents that currently require it.

			The agent does not adjust the velocity for other agents that would match the [member avoidance_mask] but have a lower [member avoidance_priority]. This in turn makes the other agents with lower priority adjust their velocities even more to avoid collision with this agent.

		<member name="debug_enabled" type="bool" setter="set_debug_enabled" getter="get_debug_enabled" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code] shows debug visuals for this agent.

		<member name="height" type="float" setter="set_height" getter="get_height" default="1.0">
			The height of the avoidance agent. Agents will ignore other agents or obstacles that are above or below their current position + height in 2D avoidance. Does nothing in 3D avoidance which uses radius spheres alone.
		</member>
		<member name="keep_y_velocity" type="bool" setter="set_keep_y_velocity" getter="get_keep_y_velocity" default="true">
			If [code]true[/code], and the agent uses 2D avoidance, it will remember the set y-axis velocity and reapply it after the avoidance step. While 2D avoidance has no y-axis and simulates on a flat plane this setting can help mitigate the most obvious clipping on uneven 3D geometry.

		<member name="max_neighbors" type="int" setter="set_max_neighbors" getter="get_max_neighbors" default="10">
			The maximum number of neighbors for the agent to consider.

		<member name="path_desired_distance" type="float" setter="set_path_desired_distance" getter="get_path_desired_distance" default="1.0">
			The distance threshold before a path point is considered to be reached. This allows agents to not have to hit a path point on the path exactly, but only to reach its general area. If this value is set too high, the NavigationAgent will skip points on the path, which can lead to leaving the navigation mesh. If this value is set too low, the NavigationAgent will be stuck in a repath loop because it will constantly overshoot or undershoot the distance to the next point on each physics frame update.
		</member>
		<member name="path_height_offset" type="float" setter="set_path_height_offset" getter="get_path_height_offset" default="0.0">
			The height offset is subtracted from the y-axis value of any vector path position for this NavigationAgent. The NavigationAgent height offset does not change or influence the navigation mesh or pathfinding query result. Additional navigation maps that use regions with navigation meshes that the developer baked with appropriate agent radius or height values are required to support different-sized agents.

		<member name="radius" type="float" setter="set_radius" getter="get_radius" default="0.5">
			The radius of the avoidance agent. This is the "body" of the avoidance agent and not the avoidance maneuver starting radius (which is controlled by [member neighbor_distance]).
			Does not affect normal pathfinding. To change an actor's pathfinding radius bake [NavigationMesh] resources with a different [member NavigationMesh.agent_radius] property and use different navigation maps for each actor size.

		<member name="time_horizon_agents" type="float" setter="set_time_horizon_agents" getter="get_time_horizon_agents" default="1.0">
			The minimal amount of time for which this agent's velocities, that are computed with the collision avoidance algorithm, are safe with respect to other agents. The larger the number, the sooner the agent will respond to other agents, but less freedom in choosing its velocities. A too high value will slow down agents movement considerably. Must be positive.

			The minimal amount of time for which this agent's velocities, that are computed with the collision avoidance algorithm, are safe with respect to static avoidance obstacles. The larger the number, the sooner the agent will respond to static avoidance obstacles, but less freedom in choosing its velocities. A too high value will slow down agents movement considerably. Must be positive.

			If [code]true[/code], the agent calculates avoidance velocities in 3D omnidirectionally, e.g. for games that take place in air, underwater or space. Agents using 3D avoidance only avoid other agents using 3D avoidance, and react to radius-based avoidance obstacles. They ignore any vertex-based obstacles.
			If [code]false[/code], the agent calculates avoidance velocities in 2D along the x and z-axes, ignoring the y-axis. Agents using 2D avoidance only avoid other agents using 2D avoidance, and react to radius-based avoidance obstacles or vertex-based avoidance obstacles. Other agents using 2D avoidance that are below or above their current position including [member height] are ignored.
