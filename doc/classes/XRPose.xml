	<brief_description>
		This object contains all data related to a pose on a tracked object.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		XR runtimes often identify multiple locations on devices such as controllers that are spatially tracked.
		Orientation, location, linear velocity and angular velocity are all provided for each pose by the XR runtime. This object contains this state of a pose.

		<method name="get_adjusted_transform" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Transform3D" />
			<description>
				Returns the [member transform] with world scale and our reference frame applied. This is the transform used to position [XRNode3D] objects.

		<member name="angular_velocity" type="Vector3" setter="set_angular_velocity" getter="get_angular_velocity" default="Vector3(0, 0, 0)">
			The angular velocity for this pose.

		<member name="has_tracking_data" type="bool" setter="set_has_tracking_data" getter="get_has_tracking_data" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code] our tracking data is up to date. If [code]false[/code] we're no longer receiving new tracking data and our state is whatever that last valid state was.

		<member name="linear_velocity" type="Vector3" setter="set_linear_velocity" getter="get_linear_velocity" default="Vector3(0, 0, 0)">
			The linear velocity of this pose.
		</member>
		<member name="name" type="StringName" setter="set_name" getter="get_name" default="&amp;&quot;&quot;">
			The name of this pose. Pose names are often driven by an action map setup by the user. Godot does suggest a number of pose names that it expects [XRInterface]s to implement:
			- [code]root[/code] defines a root location, often used for tracked objects that do not have further nodes.
			- [code]aim[/code] defines the tip of a controller with the orientation pointing outwards, for instance: add your raycasts to this.
			- [code]grip[/code] defines the location where the user grips the controller
			- [code]skeleton[/code] defines the root location a hand mesh should be placed when using hand tracking and the animated skeleton supplied by the XR runtime.

			The transform containing the original and transform as reported by the XR runtime.
