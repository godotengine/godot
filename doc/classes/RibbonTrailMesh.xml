	<description>
		[RibbonTrailMesh] represents a straight ribbon-shaped mesh with variable width. The ribbon is composed of a number of flat or cross-shaped sections, each with the same [member section_length] and number of [member section_segments]. A [member curve] is sampled along the total length of the ribbon, meaning that the curve determines the size of the ribbon along its length.
		This primitive mesh is usually used for particle trails.

		<member name="curve" type="Curve" setter="set_curve" getter="get_curve">
			Determines the size of the ribbon along its length. The size of a particular section segment is obtained by multiplying the baseline [member size] by the value of this curve at the given distance. For values smaller than [code]0[/code], the faces will be inverted. Should be a unit [Curve].
		</member>
		<member name="section_length" type="float" setter="set_section_length" getter="get_section_length" default="0.2">
			The length of a section of the ribbon.
		</member>
		<member name="section_segments" type="int" setter="set_section_segments" getter="get_section_segments" default="3">
			The number of segments in a section. The [member curve] is sampled on each segment to determine its size. Higher values result in a more detailed ribbon at the cost of performance.
		</member>
		<member name="sections" type="int" setter="set_sections" getter="get_sections" default="5">
			The total number of sections on the ribbon.
		</member>
		<member name="shape" type="int" setter="set_shape" getter="get_shape" enum="RibbonTrailMesh.Shape" default="1">
			Determines the shape of the ribbon.
		</member>
		<member name="size" type="float" setter="set_size" getter="get_size" default="1.0">
			The baseline size of the ribbon. The size of a particular section segment is obtained by multiplying this size by the value of the [member curve] at the given distance.
