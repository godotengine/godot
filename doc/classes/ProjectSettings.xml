	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Contains global variables accessible from everywhere. Use [method get_setting], [method set_setting] or [method has_setting] to access them. Variables stored in [code]project.godot[/code] are also loaded into ProjectSettings, making this object very useful for reading custom game configuration options.
		When naming a Project Settings property, use the full path to the setting including the category. For example, [code]"application/config/name"[/code] for the project name. Category and property names can be viewed in the Project Settings dialog.
		[b]Feature tags:[/b] Project settings can be overridden for specific platforms and configurations (debug, release, ...) using [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/export/feature_tags.html]feature tags[/url].
		[b]Overriding:[/b] Any project setting can be overridden by creating a file named [code]override.cfg[/code] in the project's root directory. This can also be used in exported projects by placing this file in the same directory as the project binary. Overriding will still take the base project settings' [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/export/feature_tags.html]feature tags[/url] in account. Therefore, make sure to [i]also[/i] override the setting with the desired feature tags if you want them to override base project settings on all platforms and configurations.

	<methods>
		<method name="add_property_info">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="hint" type="Dictionary" />
			<description>
				Adds a custom property info to a property. The dictionary must contain:
				- [code]name[/code]: [String] (the property's name)
				- [code]type[/code]: [int] (see [enum Variant.Type])
				- optionally [code]hint[/code]: [int] (see [enum PropertyHint]) and [code]hint_string[/code]: [String]
				[b]Example:[/b]
				[codeblock]
				ProjectSettings.set("category/property_name", 0)

				var property_info = {
				    "name": "category/property_name",
				    "type": TYPE_INT,
				    "hint": PROPERTY_HINT_ENUM,
				    "hint_string": "one,two,three"
				}

				ProjectSettings.add_property_info(property_info)
				[/codeblock]
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="clear">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<description>
				Clears the whole configuration (not recommended, may break things).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_order" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" />
			<argument index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the order of a configuration value (influences when saved to the config file).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_setting" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Variant" />
			<argument index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the value of a setting.
				[b]Example:[/b]
				[codeblock]
				print(ProjectSettings.get_setting("application/config/name"))

		</method>
		<method name="globalize_path" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="String" />
			<argument index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the absolute, native OS path corresponding to the localized [code]path[/code] (starting with [code]res://[/code] or [code]user://[/code]). The returned path will vary depending on the operating system and user preferences. See [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/io/data_paths.html]File paths in Godot projects[/url] to see what those paths convert to. See also [method localize_path].
				[b]Note:[/b] [method globalize_path] with [code]res://[/code] will not work in an exported project. Instead, prepend the executable's base directory to the path when running from an exported project:
				[codeblock]
				var path = ""
				if OS.has_feature("editor"):
				    # Running from an editor binary.
				    # `path` will contain the absolute path to `hello.txt` located in the project root.
				    path = ProjectSettings.globalize_path("res://hello.txt")
				else:
				    # Running from an exported project.
				    # `path` will contain the absolute path to `hello.txt` next to the executable.
				    # This is *not* identical to using `ProjectSettings.globalize_path()` with a `res://` path,
				    # but is close enough in spirit.
				    path = OS.get_executable_path().get_base_dir().plus_file("hello.txt")
				[/codeblock]
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="has_setting" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<argument index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if a configuration value is present.
			</description>

		<method name="load_resource_pack">
			<return type="bool" />
			<argument index="0" name="pack" type="String" />
			<argument index="1" name="replace_files" type="bool" default="true" />
			<argument index="2" name="offset" type="int" default="0" />
			<description>
				Loads the contents of the .pck or .zip file specified by [code]pack[/code] into the resource filesystem ([code]res://[/code]). Returns [code]true[/code] on success.
				[b]Note:[/b] If a file from [code]pack[/code] shares the same path as a file already in the resource filesystem, any attempts to load that file will use the file from [code]pack[/code] unless [code]replace_files[/code] is set to [code]false[/code].
				[b]Note:[/b] The optional [code]offset[/code] parameter can be used to specify the offset in bytes to the start of the resource pack. This is only supported for .pck files.

				Returns the specified property's initial value. Returns [code]null[/code] if the property does not exist.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="save">
			<return type="int" enum="Error" />
			<description>
				Saves the configuration to the [code]project.godot[/code] file.
				[b]Note:[/b] This method is intended to be used by editor plugins, as modified [ProjectSettings] can't be loaded back in the running app. If you want to change project settings in exported projects, use [method save_custom] to save [code]override.cfg[/code] file.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="save_custom">
			<return type="int" enum="Error" />
			<argument index="0" name="file" type="String" />
			<description>
				Saves the configuration to a custom file. The file extension must be [code].godot[/code] (to save in text-based [ConfigFile] format) or [code].binary[/code] (to save in binary format). You can also save [code]override.cfg[/code] file, which is also text, but can be used in exported projects unlike other formats.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_initial_value">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<argument index="1" name="value" type="Variant" />

			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_setting">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<argument index="1" name="value" type="Variant" />
			<description>
				Sets the value of a setting.
				[b]Example:[/b]
				[codeblock]
				ProjectSettings.set_setting("application/config/name", "Example")
				[/codeblock]
				This can also be used to erase custom project settings. To do this change the setting value to [code]null[/code].
			</description>
		</method>
	</methods>
	<members>
		<member name="android/modules" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			Comma-separated list of custom Android modules (which must have been built in the Android export templates) using their Java package path, e.g. [code]"org/godotengine/godot/MyCustomSingleton,com/example/foo/FrenchFriesFactory"[/code].
			[b]Note:[/b] Since Godot 3.2.2, the [code]org/godotengine/godot/GodotPaymentV3[/code] module was deprecated and replaced by the [code]GodotPayment[/code] plugin which should be enabled in the Android export preset under [code]Plugins[/code] section. The singleton to access in code was also renamed to [code]GodotPayment[/code].
		</member>
		<member name="application/boot_splash/bg_color" type="Color" setter="" getter="" default="Color( 0.14, 0.14, 0.14, 1 )">
			Background color for the boot splash.
		</member>
		<member name="application/boot_splash/fullsize" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="true">
			If [code]true[/code], scale the boot splash image to the full window size (preserving the aspect ratio) when the engine starts. If [code]false[/code], the engine will leave it at the default pixel size.
		</member>
		<member name="application/boot_splash/image" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			Path to an image used as the boot splash. If left empty, the default Godot Engine splash will be displayed instead.
			[b]Note:[/b] Only effective if [member application/boot_splash/show_image] is [code]true[/code].
		</member>
		<member name="application/boot_splash/minimum_display_time" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="0">
			Minimum boot splash display time (in milliseconds). It is not recommended to set too high values for this setting.
		</member>
		<member name="application/boot_splash/show_image" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="true">
			If [code]true[/code], displays the image specified in [member application/boot_splash/image] when the engine starts. If [code]false[/code], only displays the plain color specified in [member application/boot_splash/bg_color].
		</member>
		<member name="application/boot_splash/use_filter" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="true">
			If [code]true[/code], applies linear filtering when scaling the image (recommended for high-resolution artwork). If [code]false[/code], uses nearest-neighbor interpolation (recommended for pixel art).
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/custom_user_dir_name" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			This user directory is used for storing persistent data ([code]user://[/code] filesystem). If left empty, [code]user://[/code] resolves to a project-specific folder in Godot's own configuration folder (see [method OS.get_user_data_dir]). If a custom directory name is defined, this name will be used instead and appended to the system-specific user data directory (same parent folder as the Godot configuration folder documented in [method OS.get_user_data_dir]).
			The [member application/config/use_custom_user_dir] setting must be enabled for this to take effect.
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/description" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			The project's description, displayed as a tooltip in the Project Manager when hovering the project.
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/icon" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			Icon used for the project, set when project loads. Exporters will also use this icon when possible.
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/macos_native_icon" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			Icon set in [code].icns[/code] format used on macOS to set the game's icon. This is done automatically on start by calling [method OS.set_native_icon].
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/name" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			The project's name. It is used both by the Project Manager and by exporters. The project name can be translated by translating its value in localization files. The window title will be set to match the project name automatically on startup.
			[b]Note:[/b] Changing this value will also change the user data folder's path if [member application/config/use_custom_user_dir] is [code]false[/code]. After renaming the project, you will no longer be able to access existing data in [code]user://[/code] unless you rename the old folder to match the new project name. See [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/io/data_paths.html]Data paths[/url] in the documentation for more information.
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/project_settings_override" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			Specifies a file to override project settings. For example: [code]user://custom_settings.cfg[/code]. See "Overriding" in the [ProjectSettings] class description at the top for more information.
			[b]Note:[/b] Regardless of this setting's value, [code]res://override.cfg[/code] will still be read to override the project settings.
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/use_custom_user_dir" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], the project will save user data to its own user directory (see [member application/config/custom_user_dir_name]). This setting is only effective on desktop platforms. A name must be set in the [member application/config/custom_user_dir_name] setting for this to take effect. If [code]false[/code], the project will save user data to [code](OS user data directory)/Godot/app_userdata/(project name)[/code].
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/use_hidden_project_data_directory" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="true">
			If [code]true[/code], the project will use a hidden directory ([code].import[/code]) for storing project-specific data (metadata, shader cache, etc.).
			If [code]false[/code], a non-hidden directory ([code]import[/code]) will be used instead.
			[b]Note:[/b] Restart the application after changing this setting.
			[b]Note:[/b] Changing this value can help on platforms or with third-party tools where hidden directory patterns are disallowed. Only modify this setting if you know that your environment requires it, as changing the default can impact compatibility with some external tools or plugins which expect the default [code].import[/code] folder.
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/windows_native_icon" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			Icon set in [code].ico[/code] format used on Windows to set the game's icon. This is done automatically on start by calling [method OS.set_native_icon].
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/delta_smoothing" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="true">
			Time samples for frame deltas are subject to random variation introduced by the platform, even when frames are displayed at regular intervals thanks to V-Sync. This can lead to jitter. Delta smoothing can often give a better result by filtering the input deltas to correct for minor fluctuations from the refresh rate.
			[b]Note:[/b] Delta smoothing is only attempted when [member display/window/vsync/use_vsync] is switched on, as it does not work well without V-Sync.
			It may take several seconds at a stable frame rate before the smoothing is initially activated. It will only be active on machines where performance is adequate to render frames at the refresh rate.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/delta_sync_after_draw" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="false">
			[b]Experimental.[/b] Shifts the measurement of delta time for each frame to just after the drawing has taken place. This may lead to more consistent deltas and a reduction in frame stutters.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/disable_stderr" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], disables printing to standard error. If [code]true[/code], this also hides error and warning messages printed by [method @GDScript.push_error] and [method @GDScript.push_warning]. See also [member application/run/disable_stdout].
			Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/disable_stdout" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], disables printing to standard output. This is equivalent to starting the editor or project with the [code]--quiet[/code] command line argument. See also [member application/run/disable_stderr].
			Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/flush_stdout_on_print" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], flushes the standard output stream every time a line is printed. This affects both terminal logging and file logging.
			When running a project, this setting must be enabled if you want logs to be collected by service managers such as systemd/journalctl. This setting is disabled by default on release builds, since flushing on every printed line will negatively affect performance if lots of lines are printed in a rapid succession. Also, if this setting is enabled, logged files will still be written successfully if the application crashes or is otherwise killed by the user (without being closed "normally").
			[b]Note:[/b] Regardless of this setting, the standard error stream ([code]stderr[/code]) is always flushed when a line is printed to it.
			Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/flush_stdout_on_print.debug" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="true">
			Debug build override for [member application/run/flush_stdout_on_print], as performance is less important during debugging.
			Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/frame_delay_msec" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="0">
			Forces a delay between frames in the main loop (in milliseconds). This may be useful if you plan to disable vertical synchronization.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/low_processor_mode" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], enables low-processor usage mode. This setting only works on desktop platforms. The screen is not redrawn if nothing changes visually. This is meant for writing applications and editors, but is pretty useless (and can hurt performance) in most games.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/low_processor_mode_sleep_usec" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="6900">
			Amount of sleeping between frames when the low-processor usage mode is enabled (in microseconds). Higher values will result in lower CPU usage.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/main_scene" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			Path to the main scene file that will be loaded when the project runs.
		</member>
		<member name="audio/2d_panning_strength" type="float" setter="" getter="" default="1.0">
			The base strength of the panning effect for all AudioStreamPlayer2D nodes. The panning strength can be further scaled on each Node using [member AudioStreamPlayer2D.panning_strength].
		</member>
		<member name="audio/3d_panning_strength" type="float" setter="" getter="" default="1.0">
			The base strength of the panning effect for all AudioStreamPlayer3D nodes. The panning strength can be further scaled on each Node using [member AudioStreamPlayer3D.panning_strength].
		</member>
		<member name="audio/channel_disable_threshold_db" type="float" setter="" getter="" default="-60.0">
			Audio buses will disable automatically when sound goes below a given dB threshold for a given time. This saves CPU as effects assigned to that bus will no longer do any processing.
		</member>
		<member name="audio/channel_disable_time" type="float" setter="" getter="" default="2.0">
			Audio buses will disable automatically when sound goes below a given dB threshold for a given time. This saves CPU as effects assigned to that bus will no longer do any processing.
		</member>
		<member name="audio/default_bus_layout" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;res://default_bus_layout.tres&quot;">
			Default [AudioBusLayout] resource file to use in the project, unless overridden by the scene.
		</member>
		<member name="audio/driver" type="String" setter="" getter="">
			Specifies the audio driver to use. This setting is platform-dependent as each platform supports different audio drivers. If left empty, the default audio driver will be used.
		</member>
		<member name="audio/enable_audio_input" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], microphone input will be allowed. This requires appropriate permissions to be set when exporting to Android or iOS.
			[b]Note:[/b] If the operating system blocks access to audio input devices (due to the user's privacy settings), audio capture will only return silence. On Windows 10 and later, make sure that apps are allowed to access the microphone in the OS' privacy settings.
		</member>
		<member name="audio/general/ios/mix_with_others" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="false">
			Sets the [url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosession/categoryoptions/1616611-mixwithothers]mixWithOthers[/url] option for the AVAudioSession on iOS. This will override the mix behavior, if the category is set to [code]Play and Record[/code], [code]Playback[/code], or [code]Multi Route[/code].
			[code]Ambient[/code] always has this set per default.
		</member>
		<member name="audio/general/ios/session_category" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="0">
			Sets the [url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosessioncategory]AVAudioSessionCategory[/url] on iOS. Use the [code]Playback[/code] category to get sound output, even if the phone is in silent mode.
		</member>
		<member name="audio/general/text_to_speech" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], text-to-speech support is enabled, see [method OS.tts_get_voices] and [method OS.tts_speak].
			[b]Note:[/b] Enabling TTS can cause addition idle CPU usage and interfere with the sleep mode, so consider disabling it if TTS is not used.
		</member>
		<member name="audio/mix_rate" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="44100">
			The mixing rate used for audio (in Hz). In general, it's better to not touch this and leave it to the host operating system.
		</member>
		<member name="audio/mix_rate.web" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="0">
			Safer override for [member audio/mix_rate] in the Web platform. Here [code]0[/code] means "let the browser choose" (since some browsers do not like forcing the mix rate).
		</member>
		<member name="audio/output_latency" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="15">
			Specifies the preferred output latency in milliseconds for audio. Lower values will result in lower audio latency at the cost of increased CPU usage. Low values may result in audible cracking on slower hardware.
			Audio output latency may be constrained by the host operating system and audio hardware drivers. If the host can not provide the specified audio output latency then Godot will attempt to use the nearest latency allowed by the host. As such you should always use [method AudioServer.get_output_latency] to determine the actual audio output latency.
			[b]Note:[/b] This setting is ignored on Windows.
		</member>
		<member name="audio/output_latency.web" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="50">
			Safer override for [member audio/output_latency] in the Web platform, to avoid audio issues especially on mobile devices.
		</member>
		<member name="audio/video_delay_compensation_ms" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="0">
			Setting to hardcode audio delay when playing video. Best to leave this untouched unless you know what you are doing.
		</member>
		<member name="compression/formats/gzip/compression_level" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="-1">
			The default compression level for gzip. Affects compressed scenes and resources. Higher levels result in smaller files at the cost of compression speed. Decompression speed is mostly unaffected by the compression level. [code]-1[/code] uses the default gzip compression level, which is identical to [code]6[/code] but could change in the future due to underlying zlib updates.
		</member>
		<member name="compression/formats/zlib/compression_level" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="-1">
			The default compression level for Zlib. Affects compressed scenes and resources. Higher levels result in smaller files at the cost of compression speed. Decompression speed is mostly unaffected by the compression level. [code]-1[/code] uses the default gzip compression level, which is identical to [code]6[/code] but could change in the future due to underlying zlib updates.
		</member>
		<member name="compression/formats/zstd/compression_level" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="3">
			The default compression level for Zstandard. Affects compressed scenes and resources. Higher levels result in smaller files at the cost of compression speed. Decompression speed is mostly unaffected by the compression level.

			Enables [url=https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.3.2]long-distance matching[/url] in Zstandard.
		</member>
		<member name="compression/formats/zstd/window_log_size" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="27">
			Largest size limit (in power of 2) allowed when compressing using long-distance matching with Zstandard. Higher values can result in better compression, but will require more memory when compressing and decompressing.
		</member>
		<member name="debug/gdscript/completion/autocomplete_setters_and_getters" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], displays getters and setters in autocompletion results in the script editor. This setting is meant to be used when porting old projects (Godot 2), as using member variables is the preferred style from Godot 3 onwards.
		</member>
		<member name="debug/gdscript/warnings/constant_used_as_function" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="true">
			If [code]true[/code], enables warnings when a constant is used as a function.
