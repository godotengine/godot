	<brief_description>
		Stores globally-accessible variables.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Stores variables that can be accessed from everywhere. Use [method get_setting], [method set_setting] or [method has_setting] to access them. Variables stored in [code]project.godot[/code] are also loaded into [ProjectSettings], making this object very useful for reading custom game configuration options.
		When naming a Project Settings property, use the full path to the setting including the category. For example, [code]"application/config/name"[/code] for the project name. Category and property names can be viewed in the Project Settings dialog.
		[b]Feature tags:[/b] Project settings can be overridden for specific platforms and configurations (debug, release, ...) using [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/export/feature_tags.html]feature tags[/url].
		[b]Overriding:[/b] Any project setting can be overridden by creating a file named [code]override.cfg[/code] in the project's root directory. This can also be used in exported projects by placing this file in the same directory as the project binary. Overriding will still take the base project settings' [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/export/feature_tags.html]feature tags[/url] in account. Therefore, make sure to [i]also[/i] override the setting with the desired feature tags if you want them to override base project settings on all platforms and configurations.

	<methods>
		<method name="add_property_info">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="hint" type="Dictionary" />
			<description>
				Adds a custom property info to a property. The dictionary must contain:
				- [code]"name"[/code]: [String] (the property's name)
				- [code]"type"[/code]: [int] (see [enum Variant.Type])
				- optionally [code]"hint"[/code]: [int] (see [enum PropertyHint]) and [code]"hint_string"[/code]: [String]
				[b]Example:[/b]
				[codeblocks]
				[gdscript]
				ProjectSettings.set("category/property_name", 0)

				var property_info = {
				    "name": "category/property_name",
				    "type": TYPE_INT,
				    "hint": PROPERTY_HINT_ENUM,
				    "hint_string": "one,two,three"
				}

				ProjectSettings.add_property_info(property_info)
				[/gdscript]
				[csharp]
				ProjectSettings.Singleton.Set("category/property_name", 0);

				var propertyInfo = new Godot.Collections.Dictionary
				{
				    {"name", "category/propertyName"},
				    {"type", (int)Variant.Type.Int},
				    {"hint", (int)PropertyHint.Enum},
				    {"hint_string", "one,two,three"},
				};

				ProjectSettings.AddPropertyInfo(propertyInfo);
				[/csharp]
				[/codeblocks]
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="clear">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<description>
				Clears the whole configuration (not recommended, may break things).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_global_class_list">
			<return type="Dictionary[]" />
			<description>
				Returns an [Array] of registered global classes. Each global class is represented as a [Dictionary] that contains the following entries:
				- [code]base[/code] is a name of the base class;
				- [code]class[/code] is a name of the registered global class;
				- [code]icon[/code] is a path to a custom icon of the global class, if it has any;
				- [code]language[/code] is a name of a programming language in which the global class is written;
				- [code]path[/code] is a path to a file containing the global class.
				[b]Note:[/b] Both the script and the icon paths are local to the project filesystem, i.e. they start with [code]res://[/code].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_order" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" />
			<param index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the order of a configuration value (influences when saved to the config file).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_setting" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Variant" />
			<param index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="default_value" type="Variant" default="null" />
			<description>
				Returns the value of the setting identified by [param name]. If the setting doesn't exist and [param default_value] is specified, the value of [param default_value] is returned. Otherwise, [code]null[/code] is returned.
				[b]Example:[/b]
				[codeblocks]
				[gdscript]
				print(ProjectSettings.get_setting("application/config/name"))
				print(ProjectSettings.get_setting("application/config/custom_description", "No description specified."))
				[/gdscript]
				[csharp]
				GD.Print(ProjectSettings.GetSetting("application/config/name"));
				GD.Print(ProjectSettings.GetSetting("application/config/custom_description", "No description specified."));
				[/csharp]
				[/codeblocks]
				[b]Note:[/b] This method doesn't take potential feature overrides into account automatically. Use [method get_setting_with_override] to handle seamlessly.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_setting_with_override" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Variant" />
			<param index="0" name="name" type="StringName" />
			<description>
				Similar to [method get_setting], but applies feature tag overrides if any exists and is valid.
				[b]Example:[/b]
				If the following setting override exists "application/config/name.windows", and the following code is executed:
				[codeblocks]
				[gdscript]
				print(ProjectSettings.get_setting_with_override("application/config/name"))
				[/gdscript]
				[csharp]
				GD.Print(ProjectSettings.GetSettingWithOverride("application/config/name"));
				[/csharp]
				[/codeblocks]
				Then the overridden setting will be returned instead if the project is running on the [i]Windows[/i] operating system.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="globalize_path" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="String" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the absolute, native OS path corresponding to the localized [param path] (starting with [code]res://[/code] or [code]user://[/code]). The returned path will vary depending on the operating system and user preferences. See [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/io/data_paths.html]File paths in Godot projects[/url] to see what those paths convert to. See also [method localize_path].
				[b]Note:[/b] [method globalize_path] with [code]res://[/code] will not work in an exported project. Instead, prepend the executable's base directory to the path when running from an exported project:
				[codeblock]
				var path = ""
				if OS.has_feature("editor"):
				    # Running from an editor binary.
				    # `path` will contain the absolute path to `hello.txt` located in the project root.
				    path = ProjectSettings.globalize_path("res://hello.txt")
				else:
				    # Running from an exported project.
				    # `path` will contain the absolute path to `hello.txt` next to the executable.
				    # This is *not* identical to using `ProjectSettings.globalize_path()` with a `res://` path,
				    # but is close enough in spirit.
				    path = OS.get_executable_path().get_base_dir().path_join("hello.txt")
				[/codeblock]
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="has_setting" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if a configuration value is present.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="load_resource_pack">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="pack" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="replace_files" type="bool" default="true" />
			<param index="2" name="offset" type="int" default="0" />
			<description>
				Loads the contents of the .pck or .zip file specified by [param pack] into the resource filesystem ([code]res://[/code]). Returns [code]true[/code] on success.
				[b]Note:[/b] If a file from [param pack] shares the same path as a file already in the resource filesystem, any attempts to load that file will use the file from [param pack] unless [param replace_files] is set to [code]false[/code].
				[b]Note:[/b] The optional [param offset] parameter can be used to specify the offset in bytes to the start of the resource pack. This is only supported for .pck files.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="localize_path" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="String" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the localized path (starting with [code]res://[/code]) corresponding to the absolute, native OS [param path]. See also [method globalize_path].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="save">
			<return type="int" enum="Error" />
			<description>
				Saves the configuration to the [code]project.godot[/code] file.
				[b]Note:[/b] This method is intended to be used by editor plugins, as modified [ProjectSettings] can't be loaded back in the running app. If you want to change project settings in exported projects, use [method save_custom] to save [code]override.cfg[/code] file.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="save_custom">
			<return type="int" enum="Error" />
			<param index="0" name="file" type="String" />
			<description>
				Saves the configuration to a custom file. The file extension must be [code].godot[/code] (to save in text-based [ConfigFile] format) or [code].binary[/code] (to save in binary format). You can also save [code]override.cfg[/code] file, which is also text, but can be used in exported projects unlike other formats.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_as_basic">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="basic" type="bool" />
			<description>
				Defines if the specified setting is considered basic or advanced. Basic settings will always be shown in the project settings. Advanced settings will only be shown if the user enables the "Advanced Settings" option.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_as_internal">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="internal" type="bool" />
			<description>
				Defines if the specified setting is considered internal. An internal setting won't show up in the Project Settings dialog. This is mostly useful for addons that need to store their own internal settings without exposing them directly to the user.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_initial_value">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="value" type="Variant" />
			<description>
				Sets the specified setting's initial value. This is the value the setting reverts to.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_order">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="position" type="int" />
			<description>
				Sets the order of a configuration value (influences when saved to the config file).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_restart_if_changed">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="restart" type="bool" />
			<description>
				Sets whether a setting requires restarting the editor to properly take effect.
				[b]Note:[/b] This is just a hint to display to the user that the editor must be restarted for changes to take effect. Enabling [method set_restart_if_changed] does [i]not[/i] delay the setting being set when changed.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_setting">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="value" type="Variant" />
			<description>
				Sets the value of a setting.
				[b]Example:[/b]
				[codeblocks]
				[gdscript]
				ProjectSettings.set_setting("application/config/name", "Example")
				[/gdscript]
				[csharp]
				ProjectSettings.SetSetting("application/config/name", "Example");
				[/csharp]
				[/codeblocks]
				This can also be used to erase custom project settings. To do this change the setting value to [code]null[/code].

		</member>
		<member name="application/boot_splash/image" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			Path to an image used as the boot splash. If left empty, the default Godot Engine splash will be displayed instead.
			[b]Note:[/b] Only effective if [member application/boot_splash/show_image] is [code]true[/code].
			[b]Note:[/b] The only supported format is PNG. Using another image format will result in an error.
		</member>
		<member name="application/boot_splash/minimum_display_time" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="0">
			Minimum boot splash display time (in milliseconds). It is not recommended to set too high values for this setting.
		</member>
		<member name="application/boot_splash/show_image" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="true">
			If [code]true[/code], displays the image specified in [member application/boot_splash/image] when the engine starts. If [code]false[/code], only displays the plain color specified in [member application/boot_splash/bg_color].
		</member>
		<member name="application/boot_splash/use_filter" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="true">
			If [code]true[/code], applies linear filtering when scaling the image (recommended for high-resolution artwork). If [code]false[/code], uses nearest-neighbor interpolation (recommended for pixel art).
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/auto_accept_quit" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="true">
			If [code]true[/code], the application automatically accepts quitting requests.
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/custom_user_dir_name" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			This user directory is used for storing persistent data ([code]user://[/code] filesystem). If a custom directory name is defined, this name will be appended to the system-specific user data directory (same parent folder as the Godot configuration folder documented in [method OS.get_user_data_dir]).
			The [member application/config/use_custom_user_dir] setting must be enabled for this to take effect.
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/description" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			The project's description, displayed as a tooltip in the Project Manager when hovering the project.
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/icon" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			Icon used for the project, set when project loads. Exporters will also use this icon as a fallback if necessary.
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/macos_native_icon" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			Icon set in [code].icns[/code] format used on macOS to set the game's icon. This is done automatically on start by calling [method DisplayServer.set_native_icon].
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/name" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			The project's name. It is used both by the Project Manager and by exporters. The project name can be translated by translating its value in localization files. The window title will be set to match the project name automatically on startup.
			[b]Note:[/b] Changing this value will also change the user data folder's path if [member application/config/use_custom_user_dir] is [code]false[/code]. After renaming the project, you will no longer be able to access existing data in [code]user://[/code] unless you rename the old folder to match the new project name. See [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/io/data_paths.html]Data paths[/url] in the documentation for more information.
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/name_localized" type="Dictionary" setter="" getter="" default="{}">
			Translations of the project's name. This setting is used by OS tools to translate application name on Android, iOS and macOS.
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/project_settings_override" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			Specifies a file to override project settings. For example: [code]user://custom_settings.cfg[/code]. See "Overriding" in the [ProjectSettings] class description at the top for more information.
			[b]Note:[/b] Regardless of this setting's value, [code]res://override.cfg[/code] will still be read to override the project settings.
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/quit_on_go_back" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="true">
			If [code]true[/code], the application quits automatically when navigating back (e.g. using the system "Back" button on Android).
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/use_custom_user_dir" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], the project will save user data to its own user directory. If [member application/config/custom_user_dir_name] is empty, [code]&lt;OS user data directory&gt;/&lt;project name&gt;[/code] directory will be used. If [code]false[/code], the project will save user data to [code]&lt;OS user data directory&gt;/Godot/app_userdata/&lt;project name&gt;[/code].
			See also [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/io/data_paths.html#accessing-persistent-user-data-user]File paths in Godot projects[/url]. This setting is only effective on desktop platforms.
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/use_hidden_project_data_directory" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="true">
			If [code]true[/code], the project will use a hidden directory ([code].godot[/code]) for storing project-specific data (metadata, shader cache, etc.).
			If [code]false[/code], a non-hidden directory ([code]godot[/code]) will be used instead.
			[b]Note:[/b] Restart the application after changing this setting.
			[b]Note:[/b] Changing this value can help on platforms or with third-party tools where hidden directory patterns are disallowed. Only modify this setting if you know that your environment requires it, as changing the default can impact compatibility with some external tools or plugins which expect the default [code].godot[/code] folder.
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/version" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			The project's human-readable version identifier. This is used by exporters if the version identifier isn't overridden there. If [member application/config/version] is an empty string and the version identifier isn't overridden in an exporter, the exporter will use [code]1.0.0[/code] as a version identifier.
		</member>
		<member name="application/config/windows_native_icon" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			Icon set in [code].ico[/code] format used on Windows to set the game's icon. This is done automatically on start by calling [method DisplayServer.set_native_icon].
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/delta_smoothing" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="true">
			Time samples for frame deltas are subject to random variation introduced by the platform, even when frames are displayed at regular intervals thanks to V-Sync. This can lead to jitter. Delta smoothing can often give a better result by filtering the input deltas to correct for minor fluctuations from the refresh rate.
			[b]Note:[/b] Delta smoothing is only attempted when [member display/window/vsync/vsync_mode] is set to [code]enabled[/code], as it does not work well without V-Sync.
			It may take several seconds at a stable frame rate before the smoothing is initially activated. It will only be active on machines where performance is adequate to render frames at the refresh rate.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/disable_stderr" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], disables printing to standard error. If [code]true[/code], this also hides error and warning messages printed by [method @GlobalScope.push_error] and [method @GlobalScope.push_warning]. See also [member application/run/disable_stdout].
			Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/disable_stdout" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], disables printing to standard output. This is equivalent to starting the editor or project with the [code]--quiet[/code] [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.html]command line argument[/url]. See also [member application/run/disable_stderr].
			Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/flush_stdout_on_print" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], flushes the standard output stream every time a line is printed. This affects both terminal logging and file logging.
			When running a project, this setting must be enabled if you want logs to be collected by service managers such as systemd/journalctl. This setting is disabled by default on release builds, since flushing on every printed line will negatively affect performance if lots of lines are printed in a rapid succession. Also, if this setting is enabled, logged files will still be written successfully if the application crashes or is otherwise killed by the user (without being closed "normally").
			[b]Note:[/b] Regardless of this setting, the standard error stream ([code]stderr[/code]) is always flushed when a line is printed to it.
			Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/flush_stdout_on_print.debug" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="true">
			Debug build override for [member application/run/flush_stdout_on_print], as performance is less important during debugging.
			Changes to this setting will only be applied upon restarting the application.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/frame_delay_msec" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="0">
			Forces a [i]constant[/i] delay between frames in the main loop (in milliseconds). In most situations, [member application/run/max_fps] should be preferred as an FPS limiter as it's more precise.
			This setting can be overridden using the [code]--frame-delay &lt;ms;&gt;[/code] command line argument.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/low_processor_mode" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], enables low-processor usage mode. This setting only works on desktop platforms. The screen is not redrawn if nothing changes visually. This is meant for writing applications and editors, but is pretty useless (and can hurt performance) in most games.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/low_processor_mode_sleep_usec" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="6900">
			Amount of sleeping between frames when the low-processor usage mode is enabled (in microseconds). Higher values will result in lower CPU usage.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/main_loop_type" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;SceneTree&quot;">
			The name of the type implementing the engine's main loop.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/main_scene" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			Path to the main scene file that will be loaded when the project runs.
		</member>
		<member name="application/run/max_fps" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="0">
			Maximum number of frames per second allowed. A value of [code]0[/code] means "no limit". The actual number of frames per second may still be below this value if the CPU or GPU cannot keep up with the project logic and rendering.
			Limiting the FPS can be useful to reduce system power consumption, which reduces heat and noise emissions (and improves battery life on mobile devices).
			If [member display/window/vsync/vsync_mode] is set to [code]Enabled[/code] or [code]Adaptive[/code], it takes precedence and the forced FPS number cannot exceed the monitor's refresh rate.
			If [member display/window/vsync/vsync_mode] is [code]Enabled[/code], on monitors with variable refresh rate enabled (G-Sync/FreeSync), using a FPS limit a few frames lower than the monitor's refresh rate will [url=https://blurbusters.com/howto-low-lag-vsync-on/]reduce input lag while avoiding tearing[/url].
			If [member display/window/vsync/vsync_mode] is [code]Disabled[/code], limiting the FPS to a high value that can be consistently reached on the system can reduce input lag compared to an uncapped framerate. Since this works by ensuring the GPU load is lower than 100%, this latency reduction is only effective in GPU-bottlenecked scenarios, not CPU-bottlenecked scenarios.
			See also [member physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second].
			This setting can be overridden using the [code]--max-fps &lt;fps&gt;[/code] command line argument (including with a value of [code]0[/code] for unlimited framerate).
			[b]Note:[/b] This property is only read when the project starts. To change the rendering FPS cap at runtime, set [member Engine.max_fps] instead.
		</member>
		<member name="audio/buses/channel_disable_threshold_db" type="float" setter="" getter="" default="-60.0">
			Audio buses will disable automatically when sound goes below a given dB threshold for a given time. This saves CPU as effects assigned to that bus will no longer do any processing.
		</member>
		<member name="audio/buses/channel_disable_time" type="float" setter="" getter="" default="2.0">
			Audio buses will disable automatically when sound goes below a given dB threshold for a given time. This saves CPU as effects assigned to that bus will no longer do any processing.
		</member>
		<member name="audio/buses/default_bus_layout" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;res://default_bus_layout.tres&quot;">
			Default [AudioBusLayout] resource file to use in the project, unless overridden by the scene.
		</member>
		<member name="audio/driver/driver" type="String" setter="" getter="">
			Specifies the audio driver to use. This setting is platform-dependent as each platform supports different audio drivers. If left empty, the default audio driver will be used.
			The [code]Dummy[/code] audio driver disables all audio playback and recording, which is useful for non-game applications as it reduces CPU usage. It also prevents the engine from appearing as an application playing audio in the OS' audio mixer.
			[b]Note:[/b] The driver in use can be overridden at runtime via the [code]--audio-driver[/code] [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.html]command line argument[/url].
		</member>
		<member name="audio/driver/enable_input" type="bool" setter="" getter="" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], microphone input will be allowed. This requires appropriate permissions to be set when exporting to Android or iOS.
			[b]Note:[/b] If the operating system blocks access to audio input devices (due to the user's privacy settings), audio capture will only return silence. On Windows 10 and later, make sure that apps are allowed to access the microphone in the OS' privacy settings.
		</member>
		<member name="audio/driver/mix_rate" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="44100">
			The mixing rate used for audio (in Hz). In general, it's better to not touch this and leave it to the host operating system.
		</member>
		<member name="audio/driver/mix_rate.web" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="0">
			Safer override for [member audio/driver/mix_rate] in the Web platform. Here [code]0[/code] means "let the browser choose" (since some browsers do not like forcing the mix rate).
		</member>
		<member name="audio/driver/output_latency" type="int" setter="" getter="" default="15">
			Specifies the preferred output latency in milliseconds for audio. Lower values will result in lower audio latency at the cost of increased CPU usage. Low values may result in audible cracking on slower hardware.
			Audio output latency may be constrained by the host operating system and audio hardware drivers. If the host can not provide the specified audio output latency then Godot will attempt to use the nearest latency allowed by the host. As such you should always use [method AudioServer.get_output_latency] to determine the actual audio output latency.
			Audio output latency can be overridden using the [code]--audio-output-latency &lt;ms&gt;[/code] command line argument.
			[b]Note:[/b] This setting is ignored on Android, and on all versions of Windows prior to Windows 10.

		<member name="display/window/stretch/mode" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;disabled&quot;">
			Defines how the base size is stretched to fit the resolution of the window or screen.
			[b]"disabled"[/b]: No stretching happens. One unit in the scene corresponds to one pixel on the screen. In this mode, [member display/window/stretch/aspect] has no effect. Recommended for non-game applications.
			[b]"canvas_items"[/b]: The base size specified in width and height in the project settings is stretched to cover the whole screen (taking [member display/window/stretch/aspect] into account). This means that everything is rendered directly at the target resolution. 3D is unaffected, while in 2D, there is no longer a 1:1 correspondence between sprite pixels and screen pixels, which may result in scaling artifacts. Recommended for most games that don't use a pixel art esthetic, although it is possible to use this stretch mode for pixel art games too (especially in 3D).
			[b]"viewport"[/b]: The size of the root [Viewport] is set precisely to the base size specified in the Project Settings' Display section. The scene is rendered to this viewport first. Finally, this viewport is scaled to fit the screen (taking [member display/window/stretch/aspect] into account). Recommended for games that use a pixel art esthetic.
		</member>
		<member name="display/window/stretch/scale" type="float" setter="" getter="" default="1.0">
			The scale factor multiplier to use for 2D elements. This multiplies the final scale factor determined by [member display/window/stretch/mode]. If using the [b]Disabled[/b] stretch mode, this scale factor is applied as-is. This can be adjusted to make the UI easier to read on certain displays.
		</member>
		<member name="display/window/stretch/scale_mode" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;fractional&quot;">
			The policy to use to determine the final scale factor for 2D elements. This affects how [member display/window/stretch/scale] is applied, in addition to the automatic scale factor determined by [member display/window/stretch/mode].
			[b]"fractional"[/b]: The scale factor will not be modified.
			[b]"integer"[/b]: The scale factor will be floored to an integer value, which means that the screen size will always be an integer multiple of the base viewport size. This provides a crisp pixel art appearance.
			[b]Note:[/b] When using integer scaling with a stretch mode, resizing the window to be smaller than the base viewport size will clip the contents. Consider preventing that by setting [member Window.min_size] to the same value as the base viewport size defined in [member display/window/size/viewport_width] and [member display/window/size/viewport_height].

		<member name="editor/movie_writer/mjpeg_quality" type="float" setter="" getter="" default="0.75">
			The JPEG quality to use when writing a video to an AVI file, between [code]0.01[/code] and [code]1.0[/code] (inclusive). Higher [code]quality[/code] values result in better-looking output at the cost of larger file sizes. Recommended [code]quality[/code] values are between [code]0.75[/code] and [code]0.9[/code]. Even at quality [code]1.0[/code], JPEG compression remains lossy.

		<member name="editor/movie_writer/movie_file" type="String" setter="" getter="" default="&quot;&quot;">
			The output path for the movie. The file extension determines the [MovieWriter] that will be used.
			Godot has 2 built-in [MovieWriter]s:
			- AVI container with MJPEG for video and uncompressed audio ([code].avi[/code] file extension). Lossy compression, medium file sizes, fast encoding. The lossy compression quality can be adjusted by changing [member ProjectSettings.editor/movie_writer/mjpeg_quality]. The resulting file can be viewed in most video players, but it must be converted to another format for viewing on the web or by Godot with [VideoStreamPlayer]. MJPEG does not support transparency. AVI output is currently limited to a file of 4 GB in size at most.
			- PNG image sequence for video and WAV for audio ([code].png[/code] file extension). Lossless compression, large file sizes, slow encoding. Designed to be encoded to a video file with another tool such as [url=https://ffmpeg.org/]FFmpeg[/url] after recording. Transparency is currently not supported, even if the root viewport is set to be transparent.
			If you need to encode to a different format or pipe a stream through third-party software, you can extend this [MovieWriter] class to create your own movie writers.
			When using PNG output, the frame number will be appended at the end of the file name. It starts from 0 and is padded with 8 digits to ensure correct sorting and easier processing. For example, if the output path is [code]/tmp/hello.png[/code], the first two frames will be [code]/tmp/hello00000000.png[/code] and [code]/tmp/hello00000001.png[/code]. The audio will be saved at [code]/tmp/hello.wav[/code].

			Enables the use of physically based units for light sources. Physically based units tend to be much larger than the arbitrary units used by Godot, but they can be used to match lighting within Godot to real-world lighting. Due to the large dynamic range of lighting conditions present in nature, Godot bakes exposure into the various lighting quantities before rendering. Most light sources bake exposure automatically at run time based on the active [CameraAttributes] resource, but [LightmapGI] and [VoxelGI] require a [CameraAttributes] resource to be set at bake time to reduce the dynamic range. At run time, Godot will automatically reconcile the baked exposure with the active exposure to ensure lighting remains consistent.
