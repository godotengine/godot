	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A node that provides a [Shape3D] to a [CollisionObject3D] parent and allows to edit it. This can give a detection shape to an [Area3D] or turn a [PhysicsBody3D] into a solid object.
		[b]Warning:[/b] A non-uniformly scaled [CollisionShape3D] will likely not behave as expected. Make sure to keep its scale the same on all axes and adjust its [member shape] resource instead.
