	<description>
		A box-shaped attractor that influences particles from [GPUParticles3D] nodes. Can be used to attract particles towards its origin, or to push them away from its origin.
		Particle attractors work in real-time and can be moved, rotated and scaled during gameplay. Unlike collision shapes, non-uniform scaling of attractors is also supported.
		[b]Note:[/b] Particle attractors only affect [GPUParticles3D], not [CPUParticles3D].
