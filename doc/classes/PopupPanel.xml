	<description>
		Class for displaying popups with a panel background. In some cases it might be simpler to use than [Popup], since it provides a configurable background. If you are making windows, better check [Window].
		If any [Control] node is added as a child of this [PopupPanel], it will be stretched to fit the panel's size (similar to how [PanelContainer] works).
