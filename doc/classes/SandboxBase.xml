		Abstract base class for sandbox implementations providing default/dummy implementations.

	<description>
		SandboxBase is an abstract base class that provides default implementations for sandbox functionality. This allows the Sandbox class to work without libriscv dependencies for testing purposes.

		It provides virtual methods that can be overridden by derived classes (such as [Sandbox]) to implement full sandbox functionality. The base implementation includes basic property management, program management, function management, and statistics tracking.

		This class cannot be instantiated directly. Use [Sandbox] instead for actual sandbox functionality.
