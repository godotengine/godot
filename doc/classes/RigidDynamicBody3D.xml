	<brief_description>
		Physics Body which is moved by 3D physics simulation. Useful for objects that have gravity and can be pushed by other objects.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This is the node that implements full 3D physics. This means that you do not control a RigidDynamicBody3D directly. Instead, you can apply forces to it (gravity, impulses, etc.), and the physics simulation will calculate the resulting movement, collision, bouncing, rotating, etc.
		You can switch the body's behavior using [member lock_rotation], [member freeze], and [member freeze_mode].
		[b]Note:[/b] Don't change a RigidDynamicBody3D's position every frame or very often. Sporadic changes work fine, but physics runs at a different granularity (fixed Hz) than usual rendering (process callback) and maybe even in a separate thread, so changing this from a process loop may result in strange behavior. If you need to directly affect the body's state, use [method _integrate_forces], which allows you to directly access the physics state.
		If you need to override the default physics behavior, you can write a custom force integration function. See [member custom_integrator].

	<methods>
		<method name="_integrate_forces" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="state" type="PhysicsDirectBodyState3D" />
			<description>
				Called during physics processing, allowing you to read and safely modify the simulation state for the object. By default, it works in addition to the usual physics behavior, but the [member custom_integrator] property allows you to disable the default behavior and do fully custom force integration for a body.

		</method>
		<method name="add_central_force">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="force" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Adds a constant directional force (i.e. acceleration) without affecting rotation.
				This is equivalent to [code]add_force(force, Vector3(0,0,0))[/code].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="add_force">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="force" type="Vector3" />
			<argument index="1" name="position" type="Vector3" default="Vector3(0, 0, 0)" />
			<description>
				Adds a constant directional force (i.e. acceleration).
				The position uses the rotation of the global coordinate system, but is centered at the object's origin.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="add_torque">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="torque" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Adds a constant rotational force (i.e. a motor) without affecting position.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="apply_central_impulse">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="impulse" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Applies a directional impulse without affecting rotation.
				This is equivalent to [code]apply_impulse(Vector3(0,0,0), impulse)[/code].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="apply_impulse">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="impulse" type="Vector3" />
			<argument index="1" name="position" type="Vector3" default="Vector3(0, 0, 0)" />
			<description>
				Applies a positioned impulse to the body. An impulse is time independent! Applying an impulse every frame would result in a framerate-dependent force. For this reason it should only be used when simulating one-time impacts. The position uses the rotation of the global coordinate system, but is centered at the object's origin.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="apply_torque_impulse">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="impulse" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Applies a torque impulse which will be affected by the body mass and shape. This will rotate the body around the [code]impulse[/code] vector passed.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_colliding_bodies" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Array" />
			<description>
				Returns a list of the bodies colliding with this one. Requires [member contact_monitor] to be set to [code]true[/code] and [member contacts_reported] to be set high enough to detect all the collisions.
				[b]Note:[/b] The result of this test is not immediate after moving objects. For performance, list of collisions is updated once per frame and before the physics step. Consider using signals instead.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_inverse_inertia_tensor" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Basis" />
			<description>
				Returns the inverse inertia tensor basis. This is used to calculate the angular acceleration resulting from a torque applied to the [RigidDynamicBody3D].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_axis_velocity">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="axis_velocity" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Sets an axis velocity. The velocity in the given vector axis will be set as the given vector length. This is useful for jumping behavior.

			The body's custom center of mass, relative to the body's origin position, when [member center_of_mass_mode] is set to [constant CENTER_OF_MASS_MODE_CUSTOM]. This is the balanced point of the body, where applied forces only cause linear acceleration. Applying forces outside of the center of mass causes angular acceleration.
			When [member center_of_mass_mode] is set to [constant CENTER_OF_MASS_MODE_AUTO] (default value), the center of mass is automatically computed.

			The maximum number of contacts that will be recorded. Requires [member contact_monitor] to be set to [code]true[/code].
			[b]Note:[/b] The number of contacts is different from the number of collisions. Collisions between parallel edges will result in two contacts (one at each end), and collisions between parallel faces will result in four contacts (one at each corner).

			If [code]true[/code], continuous collision detection is used.
			Continuous collision detection tries to predict where a moving body will collide, instead of moving it and correcting its movement if it collided. Continuous collision detection is more precise, and misses fewer impacts by small, fast-moving objects. Not using continuous collision detection is faster to compute, but can miss small, fast-moving objects.

			If [code]true[/code], internal force integration will be disabled (like gravity or air friction) for this body. Other than collision response, the body will only move as determined by the [method _integrate_forces] function, if defined.

			This is multiplied by the global 3D gravity setting found in [b]Project &gt; Project Settings &gt; Physics &gt; 3d[/b] to produce RigidDynamicBody3D's gravity. For example, a value of 1 will be normal gravity, 2 will apply double gravity, and 0.5 will apply half gravity to this object.
		</member>
		<member name="inertia" type="Vector3" setter="set_inertia" getter="get_inertia" default="Vector3(0, 0, 0)">
			The body's moment of inertia. This is like mass, but for rotation: it determines how much torque it takes to rotate the body on each axis. The moment of inertia is usually computed automatically from the mass and the shapes, but this property allows you to set a custom value.
			If set to [code]Vector3.ZERO[/code], inertia is automatically computed (default value).

		<member name="linear_velocity" type="Vector3" setter="set_linear_velocity" getter="get_linear_velocity" default="Vector3(0, 0, 0)">
			The body's linear velocity. Can be used sporadically, but [b]don't set this every frame[/b], because physics may run in another thread and runs at a different granularity. Use [method _integrate_forces] as your process loop for precise control of the body state.
