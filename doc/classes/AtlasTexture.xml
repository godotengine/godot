	<description>
		[Texture2D] resource that crops out one part of the [member atlas] texture, defined by [member region]. The main use case is cropping out textures from a texture atlas, which is a big texture file that packs multiple smaller textures. Consists of a [Texture2D] for the [member atlas], a [member region] that defines the area of [member atlas] to use, and a [member margin] that defines the border width.
		[AtlasTexture] cannot be used in an [AnimatedTexture], cannot be tiled in nodes such as [TextureRect], and does not work properly if used inside of other [AtlasTexture] resources. Multiple [AtlasTexture] resources can be used to crop multiple textures from the atlas. Using a texture atlas helps to optimize video memory costs and render calls compared to using multiple small files.

		<member name="atlas" type="Texture2D" setter="set_atlas" getter="get_atlas">
			The texture that contains the atlas. Can be any [Texture2D] subtype.
		</member>
		<member name="filter_clip" type="bool" setter="set_filter_clip" getter="has_filter_clip" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], clips the area outside of the region to avoid bleeding of the surrounding texture pixels.
		</member>
		<member name="margin" type="Rect2" setter="set_margin" getter="get_margin" default="Rect2( 0, 0, 0, 0 )">
			The margin around the region. The [Rect2]'s [member Rect2.size] parameter ("w" and "h" in the editor) resizes the texture so it fits within the margin.
		</member>
		<member name="region" type="Rect2" setter="set_region" getter="get_region" default="Rect2( 0, 0, 0, 0 )">
			The AtlasTexture's used region.
