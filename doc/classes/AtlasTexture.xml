	<brief_description>
		A texture that crops out part of another Texture2D.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[Texture2D] resource that draws only part of its [member atlas] texture, as defined by the [member region]. An additional [member margin] can also be set, which is useful for small adjustments.
		Multiple [AtlasTexture] resources can be cropped from the same [member atlas]. Packing many smaller textures into a singular large texture helps to optimize video memory costs and render calls.
		[b]Note:[/b] [AtlasTexture] cannot be used in an [AnimatedTexture], and may not tile properly in nodes such as [TextureRect], when inside other [AtlasTexture] resources.

		<member name="atlas" type="Texture2D" setter="set_atlas" getter="get_atlas">
			The texture that contains the atlas. Can be any type inheriting from [Texture2D], including another [AtlasTexture].
		</member>
		<member name="filter_clip" type="bool" setter="set_filter_clip" getter="has_filter_clip" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], the area outside of the [member region] is clipped to avoid bleeding of the surrounding texture pixels.
		</member>
		<member name="margin" type="Rect2" setter="set_margin" getter="get_margin" default="Rect2(0, 0, 0, 0)">
			The margin around the [member region]. Useful for small adjustments. If the [member Rect2.size] of this property ("w" and "h" in the editor) is set, the drawn texture is resized to fit within the margin.
		</member>
		<member name="region" type="Rect2" setter="set_region" getter="get_region" default="Rect2(0, 0, 0, 0)">
			The region used to draw the [member atlas]. If either dimension of the region's size is [code]0[/code], the value from [member atlas] size will be used for that axis instead.
		</member>
		<member name="resource_local_to_scene" type="bool" setter="set_local_to_scene" getter="is_local_to_scene" overrides="Resource" default="false" />
