	<brief_description>
		A region of 2D space that detects other [CollisionObject2D]s entering or exiting it.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[Area2D] is a region of 2D space defined by one or multiple [CollisionShape2D] or [CollisionPolygon2D] child nodes. It detects when other [CollisionObject2D]s enter or exit it, and it also keeps track of which collision objects haven't exited it yet (i.e. which one are overlapping it).
		This node can also locally alter or override physics parameters (gravity, damping) and route audio to custom audio buses.
		[b]Note:[/b] Areas and bodies created with [PhysicsServer2D] might not interact as expected with [Area2D]s, and might not emit signals or track objects correctly.

		<method name="get_overlapping_areas" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Area2D[]" />
			<description>
				Returns a list of intersecting [Area2D]s. The overlapping area's [member CollisionObject2D.collision_layer] must be part of this area's [member CollisionObject2D.collision_mask] in order to be detected.
				For performance reasons (collisions are all processed at the same time) this list is modified once during the physics step, not immediately after objects are moved. Consider using signals instead.

			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="area" type="Node" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the given [Area2D] intersects or overlaps this [Area2D], [code]false[/code] otherwise.
				[b]Note:[/b] The result of this test is not immediate after moving objects. For performance, the list of overlaps is updated once per frame and before the physics step. Consider using signals instead.

				The [param body] argument can either be a [PhysicsBody2D] or a [TileMap] instance. While TileMaps are not physics bodies themselves, they register their tiles with collision shapes as a virtual physics body.

			The distance at which the gravity strength is equal to [member gravity]. For example, on a planet 100 pixels in radius with a surface gravity of 4.0 px/s², set the [member gravity] to 4.0 and the unit distance to 100.0. The gravity will have falloff according to the inverse square law, so in the example, at 200 pixels from the center the gravity will be 1.0 px/s² (twice the distance, 1/4th the gravity), at 50 pixels it will be 16.0 px/s² (half the distance, 4x the gravity), and so on.
