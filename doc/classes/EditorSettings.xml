	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Object that holds the project-independent editor settings. These settings are generally visible in the [b]Editor &gt; Editor Settings[/b] menu.
		Property names use slash delimiters to distinguish sections. Setting values can be of any [Variant] type. It's recommended to use [code]snake_case[/code] for editor settings to be consistent with the Godot editor itself.
		Accessing the settings can be done using the following methods, such as:
		[codeblocks]
		[gdscript]
		var settings = EditorInterface.get_editor_settings()
		# `settings.set("some/property", 10)` also works as this class overrides `_set()` internally.
		settings.set_setting("some/property", 10)
		# `settings.get("some/property")` also works as this class overrides `_get()` internally.
		settings.get_setting("some/property")
		var list_of_settings = settings.get_property_list()
		[/gdscript]
		[csharp]
		EditorSettings settings = EditorInterface.Singleton.GetEditorSettings();
		// `settings.set("some/property", value)` also works as this class overrides `_set()` internally.
		settings.SetSetting("some/property", Value);
		// `settings.get("some/property", value)` also works as this class overrides `_get()` internally.
		settings.GetSetting("some/property");
		Godot.Collections.Array&lt;Godot.Collections.Dictionary&gt; listOfSettings = settings.GetPropertyList();
		[/csharp]
		[/codeblocks]
		[b]Note:[/b] This class shouldn't be instantiated directly. Instead, access the singleton using [method EditorInterface.get_editor_settings].

		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/default_z_far" type="float" setter="" getter="">
			The default camera far clip distance to use in the 3D editor (in degrees). Higher values make it possible to view objects placed further away from the camera, at the cost of lower precision in the depth buffer (which can result in visible Z-fighting in the distance). The camera far clip distance can be adjusted on a per-scene basis using the [b]View[/b] menu at the top of the 3D editor. If a scene had its camera far clip distance adjusted using the [b]View[/b] menu, this setting is ignored in the scene in question. This setting is also ignored while a Camera3D node is being previewed in the editor.
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/default_z_near" type="float" setter="" getter="">
			The default camera near clip distance to use in the 3D editor (in degrees). Lower values make it possible to view objects placed closer to the camera, at the cost of lower precision in the depth buffer (which can result in visible Z-fighting in the distance). The camera near clip distance can be adjusted on a per-scene basis using the [b]View[/b] menu at the top of the 3D editor. If a scene had its camera near clip distance adjusted using the [b]View[/b] menu, this setting is ignored in the scene in question. This setting is also ignored while a Camera3D node is being previewed in the editor.

			[b]Note:[/b] On certain window managers on Linux, the [kbd]Alt[/kbd] key will be intercepted by the window manager when clicking a mouse button at the same time. This means Godot will not see the modifier key as being pressed.
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/freelook/freelook_base_speed" type="float" setter="" getter="">
			The base 3D freelook speed in units per second. This can be adjusted by using the mouse wheel while in freelook mode, or by holding down the "fast" or "slow" modifier keys ([kbd]Shift[/kbd] and [kbd]Alt[/kbd] by default, respectively).
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/freelook/freelook_inertia" type="float" setter="" getter="">
			The inertia of the 3D freelook camera. Higher values make the camera start and stop slower, which looks smoother but adds latency.
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/freelook/freelook_navigation_scheme" type="int" setter="" getter="">
			The navigation scheme to use when freelook is enabled in the 3D editor. Some of the navigation schemes below may be more convenient when designing specific levels in the 3D editor.
			- [b]Default:[/b] The "Freelook Forward", "Freelook Backward", "Freelook Up" and "Freelook Down" keys will move relative to the camera, taking its pitch angle into account for the movement.
			- [b]Partially Axis-Locked:[/b] The "Freelook Forward" and "Freelook Backward" keys will move relative to the camera, taking its pitch angle into account for the movement. The "Freelook Up" and "Freelook Down" keys will move in an "absolute" manner, [i]not[/i] taking the camera's pitch angle into account for the movement.
			- [b]Fully Axis-Locked:[/b] The "Freelook Forward", "Freelook Backward", "Freelook Up" and "Freelook Down" keys will move in an "absolute" manner, [i]not[/i] taking the camera's pitch angle into account for the movement.
			See also [member editors/3d/navigation/navigation_scheme].
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/freelook/freelook_sensitivity" type="float" setter="" getter="">
			The mouse sensitivity to use while freelook mode is active in the 3D editor. See also [member editors/3d/navigation_feel/orbit_sensitivity].

By default, when [member editors/3d/primary_grid_steps] is [code]8[/code], this means grid divisions cannot get larger than [code]64[/code] units each (so primary grid lines are [code]512[/code] units apart), no matter how far away the camera is from the grid.
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/grid_division_level_min" type="int" setter="" getter="">
			The smallest grid division to use in the 3D editor. Together with [member editors/3d/primary_grid_steps], this determines how small the grid divisions can be. The grid divisions will not be able to get smaller than [code]primary_grid_steps ^ grid_division_level_min[/code] units. By default, this means grid divisions cannot get smaller than 1 unit each, no matter how close the camera is from the grid.
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/grid_size" type="int" setter="" getter="">
			The grid size in units. Higher values prevent the grid from appearing "cut off" at certain angles, but make the grid more demanding to render. Depending on the camera's position, the grid may not be fully visible since a shader is used to fade it progressively.
