	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Object that holds the project-independent editor settings. These settings are generally visible in the [b]Editor &gt; Editor Settings[/b] menu.
		Property names use slash delimiters to distinguish sections. Setting values can be of any [Variant] type. It's recommended to use [code]snake_case[/code] for editor settings to be consistent with the Godot editor itself.
		Accessing the settings can be done using the following methods, such as:
		[codeblock]
		# `settings.set("some/property", value)` also works as this class overrides `_set()` internally.
		settings.set_setting("some/property",value)

		# `settings.get("some/property", value)` also works as this class overrides `_get()` internally.
		settings.get_setting("some/property")

		var list_of_settings = settings.get_property_list()
		[/codeblock]
		[b]Note:[/b] This class shouldn't be instantiated directly. Instead, access the singleton using [method EditorInterface.get_editor_settings].

This setting is also ignored while a Camera3D node is being previewed in the editor.
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/default_z_far" type="float" setter="" getter="">
			The default camera far clip distance to use in the 3D editor (in degrees). Higher values make it possible to view objects placed further away from the camera, at the cost of lower precision in the depth buffer (which can result in visible Z-fighting in the distance). The camera far clip distance can be adjusted on a per-scene basis using the [b]View[/b] menu at the top of the 3D editor. If a scene had its camera far clip distance adjusted using the [b]View[/b] menu, this setting is ignored in the scene in question.

			[b]Note:[/b] Regardless of this setting, the freelook toggle keyboard shortcut ([kbd]Shift + F[/kbd] by default) is always available.
			[b]Note:[/b] On certain window managers on Linux, the [kbd]Alt[/kbd] key will be intercepted by the window manager when clicking a mouse button at the same time. This means Godot will not see the modifier key as being pressed.
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/freelook/freelook_base_speed" type="float" setter="" getter="">
			The base 3D freelook speed in units per second. This can be adjusted by using the mouse wheel while in freelook mode, or by holding down the "fast" or "slow" modifier keys ([kbd]Shift[/kbd] and [kbd]Alt[/kbd] by default, respectively).
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/freelook/freelook_inertia" type="float" setter="" getter="">

		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/grid_division_level_min" type="int" setter="" getter="">
			The smallest grid division to use in the 3D editor, specified as a power of 2. The grid will not be able to get smaller than [code]1 ^ grid_division_level_min[/code] units. By default, this means grid divisions cannot get smaller than 1 unit each, no matter how close the camera is from the grid.
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/grid_size" type="int" setter="" getter="">
			The grid size in units. Higher values prevent the grid from appearing "cut off" at certain angles, but make the grid more demanding to render. Depending on the camera's position, the grid may not be fully visible since a shader is used to fade it progressively.
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/grid_xy_plane" type="bool" setter="" getter="">
			If [code]true[/code], render the grid on an XY plane. This can be useful for 3D side-scrolling games.

			The number of CPU threads to use for baking lightmaps with [BakedLightmap]. A value of [code]0[/code] will use all CPU logical cores, while positive values will set the maximum number of CPU threads that can be used when baking lightmaps. Negative values will use all CPU cores [i]minus[/i] the amount specified in the negative number.
			Using less CPU cores than the total amount of cores available will slow down lightmap baking, but will allow other tasks on the PC to be more reactive while lightmaps are baking.
		</member>
		<member name="editors/3d/navigation/emulate_3_button_mouse" type="bool" setter="" getter="">
			If [code]true[/code], enables 3-button mouse emulation mode. This is useful on laptops when using a trackpad.
