	<description>
		Resource for environment nodes (like [WorldEnvironment]) that define multiple environment operations (such as background [Sky] or [Color], ambient light, fog, depth-of-field...). These parameters affect the final render of the scene. The order of these operations is:
		- Depth of Field Blur
		- Glow
		- Tonemap (Auto Exposure)
		- Adjustments

			This is useful to simulate [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_perspective]aerial perspective[/url] in large scenes with low density fog. However, it is not very useful for high-density fog, as the sky will shine through. When set to [code]1.0[/code], the fog color comes completely from the [Sky]. If set to [code]0.0[/code], aerial perspective is disabled.
		</member>
		<member name="fog_density" type="float" setter="set_fog_density" getter="get_fog_density" default="0.01">
			The [i]exponential[/i] fog density to use. Higher values result in a more dense fog. Fog rendering is exponential as in real life.

		</member>
		<member name="glow_enabled" type="bool" setter="set_glow_enabled" getter="is_glow_enabled" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], the glow effect is enabled.
			[b]Note:[/b] Glow is only supported in the Forward+ and Mobile rendering methods, not Compatibility. When using the Mobile rendering method, glow will look different due to the lower dynamic range available in the Mobile rendering method.

			The bleed scale of the HDR glow.
		</member>
		<member name="glow_hdr_threshold" type="float" setter="set_glow_hdr_bleed_threshold" getter="get_glow_hdr_bleed_threshold" default="1.0">
			The lower threshold of the HDR glow. When using the Mobile rendering method (which only supports a lower dynamic range up to [code]2.0[/code]), this may need to be below [code]1.0[/code] for glow to be visible. A value of [code]0.9[/code] works well in this case. This value also needs to be decreased below [code]1.0[/code] when using glow in 2D, as 2D rendering is performed in SDR.
		</member>
		<member name="glow_intensity" type="float" setter="set_glow_intensity" getter="get_glow_intensity" default="0.8">
			The overall brightness multiplier of the glow effect. When using the Mobile rendering method (which only supports a lower dynamic range up to [code]2.0[/code]), this should be increased to [code]1.5[/code] to compensate.

		<member name="glow_map" type="Texture" setter="set_glow_map" getter="get_glow_map">
			The texture that should be used as a glow map to [i]multiply[/i] the resulting glow color according to [member glow_map_strength]. This can be used to create a "lens dirt" effect. The texture's RGB color channels are used for modulation, but the alpha channel is ignored.
			[b]Note:[/b] The texture will be stretched to fit the screen. Therefore, it's recommended to use a texture with an aspect ratio that matches your project's base aspect ratio (typically 16:9).
		</member>
		<member name="glow_map_strength" type="float" setter="set_glow_map_strength" getter="get_glow_map_strength" default="0.8">
			How strong of an impact the [member glow_map] should have on the overall glow effect. A strength of [code]0.0[/code] means the glow map has no effect on the overall glow effect. A strength of [code]1.0[/code] means the glow has a full effect on the overall glow effect (and can turn off glow entirely in specific areas of the screen if the glow map has black areas).
		</member>
		<member name="glow_mix" type="float" setter="set_glow_mix" getter="get_glow_mix" default="0.05">
			When using the [constant GLOW_BLEND_MODE_MIX] [member glow_blend_mode], this controls how much the source image is blended with the glow layer. A value of [code]0.0[/code] makes the glow rendering invisible, while a value of [code]1.0[/code] is equivalent to [constant GLOW_BLEND_MODE_REPLACE].
		</member>
		<member name="glow_normalized" type="bool" setter="set_glow_normalized" getter="is_glow_normalized" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], glow levels will be normalized so that summed together their intensities equal [code]1.0[/code].
		</member>
		<member name="glow_strength" type="float" setter="set_glow_strength" getter="get_glow_strength" default="1.0">
			The strength of the glow effect. This applies as the glow is blurred across the screen and increases the distance and intensity of the blur. When using the Mobile rendering method, this should be increased to compensate for the lower dynamic range.

			The reflected (specular) light source.
		</member>
		<member name="sdfgi_bounce_feedback" type="float" setter="set_sdfgi_bounce_feedback" getter="get_sdfgi_bounce_feedback" default="0.5">
			The energy multiplier applied to light every time it bounces from a surface when using SDFGI. Values greater than [code]0.0[/code] will simulate multiple bounces, resulting in a more realistic appearance. Increasing [member sdfgi_bounce_feedback] generally has no performance impact. See also [member sdfgi_energy].
			[b]Note:[/b] Values greater than [code]0.5[/code] can cause infinite feedback loops and should be avoided in scenes with bright materials.
			[b]Note:[/b] If [member sdfgi_bounce_feedback] is [code]0.0[/code], indirect lighting will not be represented in reflections as light will only bounce one time.
		</member>
		<member name="sdfgi_cascade0_distance" type="float" setter="set_sdfgi_cascade0_distance" getter="get_sdfgi_cascade0_distance" default="12.8">
			[b]Note:[/b] This property is linked to [member sdfgi_min_cell_size] and [member sdfgi_max_distance]. Changing its value will automatically change those properties as well.
		</member>
		<member name="sdfgi_cascades" type="int" setter="set_sdfgi_cascades" getter="get_sdfgi_cascades" default="4">
			The number of cascades to use for SDFGI (between 1 and 8). A higher number of cascades allows displaying SDFGI further away while preserving detail up close, at the cost of performance. When using SDFGI on small-scale levels, [member sdfgi_cascades] can often be decreased between [code]1[/code] and [code]4[/code] to improve performance.
		</member>
		<member name="sdfgi_enabled" type="bool" setter="set_sdfgi_enabled" getter="is_sdfgi_enabled" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], enables signed distance field global illumination for meshes that have their [member GeometryInstance3D.gi_mode] set to [constant GeometryInstance3D.GI_MODE_STATIC]. SDFGI is a real-time global illumination technique that works well with procedurally generated and user-built levels, including in situations where geometry is created during gameplay. The signed distance field is automatically generated around the camera as it moves. Dynamic lights are supported, but dynamic occluders and emissive surfaces are not.
			[b]Note:[/b] SDFGI is only supported in the Forward+ rendering method, not Mobile or Compatibility.
			[b]Performance:[/b] SDFGI is relatively demanding on the GPU and is not suited to low-end hardware such as integrated graphics (consider [LightmapGI] instead). To improve SDFGI performance, enable [member ProjectSettings.rendering/global_illumination/gi/use_half_resolution] in the Project Settings.
			[b]Note:[/b] Meshes should have sufficiently thick walls to avoid light leaks (avoid one-sided walls). For interior levels, enclose your level geometry in a sufficiently large box and bridge the loops to close the mesh.
		</member>
		<member name="sdfgi_energy" type="float" setter="set_sdfgi_energy" getter="get_sdfgi_energy" default="1.0">
			The energy multiplier to use for SDFGI. Higher values will result in brighter indirect lighting and reflections. See also [member sdfgi_bounce_feedback].
		</member>
		<member name="sdfgi_max_distance" type="float" setter="set_sdfgi_max_distance" getter="get_sdfgi_max_distance" default="204.8">
			The maximum distance at which SDFGI is visible. Beyond this distance, environment lighting or other sources of GI such as [ReflectionProbe] will be used as a fallback.
			[b]Note:[/b] This property is linked to [member sdfgi_min_cell_size] and [member sdfgi_cascade0_distance]. Changing its value will automatically change those properties as well.
		</member>
		<member name="sdfgi_min_cell_size" type="float" setter="set_sdfgi_min_cell_size" getter="get_sdfgi_min_cell_size" default="0.2">
			The cell size to use for the closest SDFGI cascade (in 3D units). Lower values allow SDFGI to be more precise up close, at the cost of making SDFGI updates more demanding. This can cause stuttering when the camera moves fast. Higher values allow SDFGI to cover more ground, while also reducing the performance impact of SDFGI updates.
			[b]Note:[/b] This property is linked to [member sdfgi_max_distance] and [member sdfgi_cascade0_distance]. Changing its value will automatically change those properties as well.
		</member>
		<member name="sdfgi_normal_bias" type="float" setter="set_sdfgi_normal_bias" getter="get_sdfgi_normal_bias" default="1.1">
			The normal bias to use for SDFGI probes. Increasing this value can reduce visible streaking artifacts on sloped surfaces, at the cost of increased light leaking.
		</member>
		<member name="sdfgi_probe_bias" type="float" setter="set_sdfgi_probe_bias" getter="get_sdfgi_probe_bias" default="1.1">
			The constant bias to use for SDFGI probes. Increasing this value can reduce visible streaking artifacts on sloped surfaces, at the cost of increased light leaking.

		<member name="sdfgi_read_sky_light" type="bool" setter="set_sdfgi_read_sky_light" getter="is_sdfgi_reading_sky_light" default="true">
			If [code]true[/code], SDFGI takes the environment lighting into account. This should be set to [code]false[/code] for interior scenes.
		</member>
		<member name="sdfgi_use_occlusion" type="bool" setter="set_sdfgi_use_occlusion" getter="is_sdfgi_using_occlusion" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], SDFGI uses an occlusion detection approach to reduce light leaking. Occlusion may however introduce dark blotches in certain spots, which may be undesired in mostly outdoor scenes. [member sdfgi_use_occlusion] has a performance impact and should only be enabled when needed.
		</member>
		<member name="sdfgi_y_scale" type="int" setter="set_sdfgi_y_scale" getter="get_sdfgi_y_scale" enum="Environment.SDFGIYScale" default="1">
			The Y scale to use for SDFGI cells. Lower values will result in SDFGI cells being packed together more closely on the Y axis. This is used to balance between quality and covering a lot of vertical ground. [member sdfgi_y_scale] should be set depending on how vertical your scene is (and how fast your camera may move on the Y axis).
		</member>
		<member name="sky" type="Sky" setter="set_sky" getter="get_sky">
			The [Sky] resource used for this [Environment].
		</member>
		<member name="sky_custom_fov" type="float" setter="set_sky_custom_fov" getter="get_sky_custom_fov" default="0.0">
			If set to a value greater than [code]0.0[/code], overrides the field of view to use for sky rendering. If set to [code]0.0[/code], the same FOV as the current [Camera3D] is used for sky rendering.
		</member>
		<member name="sky_rotation" type="Vector3" setter="set_sky_rotation" getter="get_sky_rotation" default="Vector3(0, 0, 0)">

			The screen-space ambient occlusion intensity on materials that have an AO texture defined. Values higher than [code]0[/code] will make the SSAO effect visible in areas darkened by AO textures.
		</member>
		<member name="ssao_detail" type="float" setter="set_ssao_detail" getter="get_ssao_detail" default="0.5">
			Sets the strength of the additional level of detail for the screen-space ambient occlusion effect. A high value makes the detail pass more prominent, but it may contribute to aliasing in your final image.
		</member>
		<member name="ssao_enabled" type="bool" setter="set_ssao_enabled" getter="is_ssao_enabled" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], the screen-space ambient occlusion effect is enabled. This darkens objects' corners and cavities to simulate ambient light not reaching the entire object as in real life. This works well for small, dynamic objects, but baked lighting or ambient occlusion textures will do a better job at displaying ambient occlusion on large static objects. Godot uses a form of SSAO called Adaptive Screen Space Ambient Occlusion which is itself a form of Horizon Based Ambient Occlusion.
			[b]Note:[/b] SSAO is only supported in the Forward+ rendering method, not Mobile or Compatibility.
		</member>
		<member name="ssao_horizon" type="float" setter="set_ssao_horizon" getter="get_ssao_horizon" default="0.06">
			The threshold for considering whether a given point on a surface is occluded or not represented as an angle from the horizon mapped into the [code]0.0-1.0[/code] range. A value of [code]1.0[/code] results in no occlusion.
		</member>
		<member name="ssao_intensity" type="float" setter="set_ssao_intensity" getter="get_ssao_intensity" default="2.0">
			The primary screen-space ambient occlusion intensity. Acts as a multiplier for the screen-space ambient occlusion effect. A higher value results in darker occlusion.
		</member>
		<member name="ssao_light_affect" type="float" setter="set_ssao_direct_light_affect" getter="get_ssao_direct_light_affect" default="0.0">
			The screen-space ambient occlusion intensity in direct light. In real life, ambient occlusion only applies to indirect light, which means its effects can't be seen in direct light. Values higher than [code]0[/code] will make the SSAO effect visible in direct light.
		</member>
		<member name="ssao_power" type="float" setter="set_ssao_power" getter="get_ssao_power" default="1.5">
			The distribution of occlusion. A higher value results in darker occlusion, similar to [member ssao_intensity], but with a sharper falloff.
		</member>
		<member name="ssao_radius" type="float" setter="set_ssao_radius" getter="get_ssao_radius" default="1.0">
			The distance at which objects can occlude each other when calculating screen-space ambient occlusion. Higher values will result in occlusion over a greater distance at the cost of performance and quality.
		</member>
		<member name="ssao_sharpness" type="float" setter="set_ssao_sharpness" getter="get_ssao_sharpness" default="0.98">
			The amount that the screen-space ambient occlusion effect is allowed to blur over the edges of objects. Setting too high will result in aliasing around the edges of objects. Setting too low will make object edges appear blurry.
		</member>
		<member name="ssil_enabled" type="bool" setter="set_ssil_enabled" getter="is_ssil_enabled" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], the screen-space indirect lighting effect is enabled. Screen space indirect lighting is a form of indirect lighting that allows diffuse light to bounce between nearby objects. Screen-space indirect lighting works very similarly to screen-space ambient occlusion, in that it only affects a limited range. It is intended to be used along with a form of proper global illumination like SDFGI or [VoxelGI]. Screen-space indirect lighting is not affected by individual light's [member Light3D.light_indirect_energy].
			[b]Note:[/b] SSIL is only supported in the Forward+ rendering method, not Mobile or Compatibility.
		</member>
		<member name="ssil_intensity" type="float" setter="set_ssil_intensity" getter="get_ssil_intensity" default="1.0">
			The brightness multiplier for the screen-space indirect lighting effect. A higher value will result in brighter light.
		</member>
		<member name="ssil_normal_rejection" type="float" setter="set_ssil_normal_rejection" getter="get_ssil_normal_rejection" default="1.0">
			Amount of normal rejection used when calculating screen-space indirect lighting. Normal rejection uses the normal of a given sample point to reject samples that are facing away from the current pixel. Normal rejection is necessary to avoid light leaking when only one side of an object is illuminated. However, normal rejection can be disabled if light leaking is desirable, such as when the scene mostly contains emissive objects that emit light from faces that cannot be seen from the camera.
		</member>
		<member name="ssil_radius" type="float" setter="set_ssil_radius" getter="get_ssil_radius" default="5.0">
			The distance that bounced lighting can travel when using the screen space indirect lighting effect. A larger value will result in light bouncing further in a scene, but may result in under-sampling artifacts which look like long spikes surrounding light sources.

			The amount that the screen-space indirect lighting effect is allowed to blur over the edges of objects. Setting too high will result in aliasing around the edges of objects. Setting too low will make object edges appear blurry.

			The amount by which to blend the last frame with the current frame. A higher number results in smoother volumetric fog, but makes "ghosting" much worse. A lower value reduces ghosting but can result in the per-frame temporal jitter becoming visible.

		<member name="volumetric_fog_temporal_reprojection_enabled" type="bool" setter="set_volumetric_fog_temporal_reprojection_enabled" getter="is_volumetric_fog_temporal_reprojection_enabled" default="true">
			Enables temporal reprojection in the volumetric fog. Temporal reprojection blends the current frame's volumetric fog with the last frame's volumetric fog to smooth out jagged edges. The performance cost is minimal; however, it leads to moving [FogVolume]s and [Light3D]s "ghosting" and leaving a trail behind them. When temporal reprojection is enabled, try to avoid moving [FogVolume]s or [Light3D]s too fast. Short-lived dynamic lighting effects should have [member Light3D.light_volumetric_fog_energy] set to [code]0.0[/code] to avoid ghosting.
