		Cylinder shape for 3D collisions.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Cylinder shape for collisions. Like [CapsuleShape3D], but without hemispheres at the cylinder's ends.
		[b]Note:[/b] There are several known bugs with cylinder collision shapes. Using [CapsuleShape3D] or [BoxShape3D] instead is recommended.
		[b]Performance:[/b] Being a primitive collision shape, [CylinderShape3D] is fast to check collisions against (though not as fast as [SphereShape3D]). [CylinderShape3D] is also more demanding compared to [CapsuleShape3D].
