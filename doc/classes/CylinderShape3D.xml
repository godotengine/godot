	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A 3D cylinder shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide a shape for a [CollisionShape3D].
		[b]Note:[/b] There are several known bugs with cylinder collision shapes. Using [CapsuleShape3D] or [BoxShape3D] instead is recommended.
		[b]Performance:[/b] [CylinderShape3D] is fast to check collisions against, but it is slower than [CapsuleShape3D], [BoxShape3D], and [SphereShape3D].
