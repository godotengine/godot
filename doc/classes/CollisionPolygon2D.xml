		Node that represents a 2D collision polygon.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Provides a 2D collision polygon to a [CollisionObject2D] parent. Polygons can be drawn in the editor or specified by a list of vertices.
		Depending on the build mode, this node effectively provides several convex shapes (by convex decomposition of the polygon) or a single concave shape made of the polygon's segments.
		In the editor, a [CollisionPolygon2D] can be generated from a [Sprite2D]'s outline by selecting a [Sprite2D] node, going to the [b]Sprite2D[/b] menu at the top of the 2D editor viewport then choosing [b]Create CollisionPolygon2D Sibling[/b].

			The margin used for one-way collision (in pixels). Higher values will make the shape thicker, and work better for colliders that enter the polygon at a high velocity.

			The polygon's list of vertices. Each point will be connected to the next, and the final point will be connected to the first.

	<constants>
		<constant name="BUILD_SOLIDS" value="0" enum="BuildMode">
			Collisions will include the polygon and its contained area. In this mode the node has the same effect as several [ConvexPolygonShape2D] nodes, one for each convex shape in the convex decomposition of the polygon (but without the overhead of multiple nodes).
		</constant>
		<constant name="BUILD_SEGMENTS" value="1" enum="BuildMode">
			Collisions will only include the polygon edges. In this mode the node has the same effect as a single [ConcavePolygonShape2D] made of segments, with the restriction that each segment (after the first one) starts where the previous one ends, and the last one ends where the first one starts (forming a closed but hollow polygon).
