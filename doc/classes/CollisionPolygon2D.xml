	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A node that provides a polygon shape to a [CollisionObject2D] parent and allows to edit it. The polygon can be concave or convex. This can give a detection shape to an [Area2D], turn [PhysicsBody2D] into a solid object, or give a hollow shape to a [StaticBody2D].
		[b]Warning:[/b] A non-uniformly scaled [CollisionShape2D] will likely not behave as expected. Make sure to keep its scale the same on all axes and adjust its shape resource instead.

			The margin used for one-way collision (in pixels). Higher values will make the shape thicker, and work better for colliders that enter the polygon at a high velocity.

	<constants>
		<constant name="BUILD_SOLIDS" value="0" enum="BuildMode">
			Collisions will include the polygon and its contained area. In this mode the node has the same effect as several [ConvexPolygonShape2D] nodes, one for each convex shape in the convex decomposition of the polygon (but without the overhead of multiple nodes).
		</constant>
		<constant name="BUILD_SEGMENTS" value="1" enum="BuildMode">
			Collisions will only include the polygon edges. In this mode the node has the same effect as a single [ConcavePolygonShape2D] made of segments, with the restriction that each segment (after the first one) starts where the previous one ends, and the last one ends where the first one starts (forming a closed but hollow polygon).
