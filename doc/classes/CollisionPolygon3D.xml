	<brief_description>
		Node that represents a 3D collision polygon, given by the thickening of a 2D polygon in the local XY plane along the local Z axis.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Provides a 3D collision polygon to a [CollisionObject3D] parent, by thickening a 2D (convex or concave) polygon in the local XY plane along the local Z axis. The 2D polygon in the local XY plane can be drawn in the editor or specified by a list of vertices. That 2D polygon is thickened evenly in the local Z and -Z directions.
		This node has the same effect as several [ConvexPolygonShape3D] nodes, created by thickening the 2D convex polygons in the convex decomposition of the given 2D polygon (but without the overhead of multiple nodes).
		[b]Warning:[/b] A non-uniformly scaled CollisionPolygon3D node will probably not function as expected. Please make sure to keep its scale uniform (i.e. the same on all axes), and change its [member polygon]'s vertices instead.
