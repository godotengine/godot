	<brief_description>
		A texture that shows 3 different curves (stored on the red, green and blue color channels).
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Renders 3 given [Curve]s provided to it, on the red, green and blue channels respectively. Compared to using separate [CurveTexture]s, this further simplifies the task of drawing curves and/or saving them as image files.
		If you only need to store one curve within a single texture, use [CurveTexture] instead. See also [GradientTexture1D] and [GradientTexture2D].

			The width of the texture (in pixels). Higher values make it possible to represent high-frequency data better (such as sudden direction changes), at the cost of increased generation time and memory usage.
