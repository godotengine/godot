	<brief_description>
		Adds a pitch-shifting audio effect to an audio bus.
		Raises or lowers the pitch of original sound.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Allows modulation of pitch independently of tempo. All frequencies can be increased/decreased with minimal effect on transients.

		<member name="fft_size" type="int" setter="set_fft_size" getter="get_fft_size" enum="AudioEffectPitchShift.FFTSize" default="3">
			The size of the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform]Fast Fourier transform[/url] buffer. Higher values smooth out the effect over time, but have greater latency. The effects of this higher latency are especially noticeable on sounds that have sudden amplitude changes.
		</member>
		<member name="oversampling" type="int" setter="set_oversampling" getter="get_oversampling" default="4">
			The oversampling factor to use. Higher values result in better quality, but are more demanding on the CPU and may cause audio cracking if the CPU can't keep up.
		</member>
		<member name="pitch_scale" type="float" setter="set_pitch_scale" getter="get_pitch_scale" default="1.0">
			The pitch scale to use. [code]1.0[/code] is the default pitch and plays sounds unaffected. [member pitch_scale] can range from [code]0.0[/code] (infinitely low pitch, inaudible) to [code]16[/code] (16 times higher than the initial pitch).

		<constant name="FFT_SIZE_256" value="0" enum="FFTSize">
			Use a buffer of 256 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. Lowest latency, but least stable over time.

		<constant name="FFT_SIZE_512" value="1" enum="FFTSize">
			Use a buffer of 512 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. Low latency, but less stable over time.

		<constant name="FFT_SIZE_1024" value="2" enum="FFTSize">
			Use a buffer of 1024 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. This is a compromise between latency and stability over time.

			Use a buffer of 2048 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. High latency, but stable over time.

			Use a buffer of 4096 samples for the Fast Fourier transform. Highest latency, but most stable over time.

			Represents the size of the [enum FFTSize] enum.
