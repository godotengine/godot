		Six square textures representing the faces of a cube. Commonly used as a skybox.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A cubemap is made of 6 textures organized in layers. They are typically used for faking reflections in 3D rendering (see [ReflectionProbe]). It can be used to make an object look as if it's reflecting its surroundings. This usually delivers much better performance than other reflection methods.
		This resource is typically used as a uniform in custom shaders. Few core Godot methods make use of [Cubemap] resources.
		To create such a texture file yourself, reimport your image files using the Godot Editor import presets. To create a Cubemap from code, use [method ImageTextureLayered.create_from_images] on an instance of the Cubemap class.
		The expected image order is X+, X-, Y+, Y-, Z+, Z- (in Godot's coordinate system, so Y+ is "up" and Z- is "forward"). You can use one of the following templates as a base:
		- [url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-docs/master/tutorials/assets_pipeline/img/cubemap_template_2x3.webp]2×3 cubemap template (default layout option)[/url]
		- [url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-docs/master/tutorials/assets_pipeline/img/cubemap_template_3x2.webp]3×2 cubemap template[/url]
		- [url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-docs/master/tutorials/assets_pipeline/img/cubemap_template_1x6.webp]1×6 cubemap template[/url]
		- [url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godotengine/godot-docs/master/tutorials/assets_pipeline/img/cubemap_template_6x1.webp]6×1 cubemap template[/url]
		[b]Note:[/b] Godot doesn't support using cubemaps in a [PanoramaSkyMaterial]. To use a cubemap as a skybox, convert the default [PanoramaSkyMaterial] to a [ShaderMaterial] using the [b]Convert to ShaderMaterial[/b] resource dropdown option, then replace its code with the following:
		[codeblock lang=text]
		shader_type sky;

		uniform samplerCube source_panorama : filter_linear, source_color, hint_default_black;
		uniform float exposure : hint_range(0, 128) = 1.0;

		void sky() {
			// If importing a cubemap from another engine, you may need to flip one of the `EYEDIR` components below
			// by replacing it with `-EYEDIR`.
			vec3 eyedir = vec3(EYEDIR.x, EYEDIR.y, EYEDIR.z);
			COLOR = texture(source_panorama, eyedir).rgb * exposure;
		}
		[/codeblock]
		After replacing the shader code and saving, specify the imported Cubemap resource in the Shader Parameters section of the ShaderMaterial in the inspector.
		Alternatively, you can use [url=https://danilw.github.io/GLSL-howto/cubemap_to_panorama_js/cubemap_to_panorama.html]this tool[/url] to convert a cubemap to an equirectangular sky map and use [PanoramaSkyMaterial] as usual.
