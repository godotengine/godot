			Amount of amplification in decibels. Positive values make the sound louder, negative values make it quieter. Value can range from -80 to 24.
		</member>
		<member name="volume_linear" type="float" setter="set_volume_linear" getter="get_volume_linear">
			Amount of amplification as a linear value.
			[b]Note:[/b] This member modifies [member volume_db] for convenience. The returned value is equivalent to the result of [method @GlobalScope.db_to_linear] on [member volume_db]. Setting this member is equivalent to setting [member volume_db] to the result of [method @GlobalScope.linear_to_db] on a value.
