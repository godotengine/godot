		<method name="clip_polygons">
			<return type="PackedVector2Array[]" />
			<param index="0" name="polygon_a" type="PackedVector2Array" />
			<param index="1" name="polygon_b" type="PackedVector2Array" />
			<description>
				Clips [param polygon_a] against [param polygon_b] and returns an array of clipped polygons. This performs [constant OPERATION_DIFFERENCE] between polygons. Returns an empty array if [param polygon_b] completely overlaps [param polygon_a].
				If [param polygon_b] is enclosed by [param polygon_a], returns an outer polygon (boundary) and inner polygon (hole) which could be distinguished by calling [method is_polygon_clockwise].

			<param index="1" name="polygon" type="PackedVector2Array" />
			<description>
				Clips [param polyline] against [param polygon] and returns an array of clipped polylines. This performs [constant OPERATION_DIFFERENCE] between the polyline and the polygon. This operation can be thought of as cutting a line with a closed shape.

			<param index="2" name="join_type" type="int" enum="Geometry2D.PolyJoinType" default="0" />
			<description>
				Inflates or deflates [param polygon] by [param delta] units (pixels). If [param delta] is positive, makes the polygon grow outward. If [param delta] is negative, shrinks the polygon inward. Returns an array of polygons because inflating/deflating may result in multiple discrete polygons. Returns an empty array if [param delta] is negative and the absolute value of it approximately exceeds the minimum bounding rectangle dimensions of the polygon.
				Each polygon's vertices will be rounded as determined by [param join_type], see [enum PolyJoinType].
				The operation may result in an outer polygon (boundary) and inner polygon (hole) produced which could be distinguished by calling [method is_polygon_clockwise].
				[b]Note:[/b] To translate the polygon's vertices specifically, multiply them to a [Transform2D]:
				[codeblocks]
				[gdscript]
				var polygon = PackedVector2Array([Vector2(0, 0), Vector2(100, 0), Vector2(100, 100), Vector2(0, 100)])
