	<brief_description>
		A 2×3 matrix representing a 2D transformation.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The [Transform2D] built-in [Variant] type is a 2×3 [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)]matrix[/url] representing a transformation in 2D space. It contains three [Vector2] values: [member x], [member y], and [member origin]. Together, they can represent translation, rotation, scale, and skew.
		The [member x] and [member y] axes form a 2×2 matrix, known as the transform's [b]basis[/b]. The length of each axis ([method Vector2.length]) influences the transform's scale, while the direction of all axes influence the rotation. Usually, both axes are perpendicular to one another. However, when you rotate one axis individually, the transform becomes skewed. Applying a skewed transform to a 2D sprite will make the sprite appear distorted.
		For a general introduction, see the [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/math/matrices_and_transforms.html]Matrices and transforms[/url] tutorial.
		[b]Note:[/b] Unlike [Transform3D], there is no 2D equivalent to the [Basis] type. All mentions of "basis" refer to the [member x] and [member y] components of [Transform2D].

	<methods>
		<method name="affine_inverse" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Transform2D" />
			<description>
				Returns the inverted version of this transform. Unlike [method inverse], this method works with almost any basis, including non-uniform ones, but is slower.
				[b]Note:[/b] For this method to return correctly, the transform's basis needs to have a determinant that is not exactly [code]0.0[/code] (see [method determinant]).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="basis_xform" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Vector2" />
			<param index="0" name="v" type="Vector2" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of the [param v] vector, transformed (multiplied) by the transform basis's matrix. Unlike the multiplication operator ([code]*[/code]), this method ignores the [member origin].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="basis_xform_inv" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Vector2" />
			<param index="0" name="v" type="Vector2" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of the [param v] vector, transformed (multiplied) by the inverse transform basis's matrix (see [method inverse]). This method ignores the [member origin].
				[b]Note:[/b] This method assumes that this transform's basis is [i]orthonormal[/i] (see [method orthonormalized]). If the basis is not orthonormal, [code]transform.affine_inverse().basis_xform(vector)[/code] should be used instead (see [method affine_inverse]).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="determinant" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="float" />
			<description>
				Returns the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant]determinant[/url] of this transform basis's matrix. For advanced math, this number can be used to determine a few attributes:
				- If the determinant is exactly [code]0.0[/code], the basis is not invertible (see [method inverse]).
				- If the determinant is a negative number, the basis represents a negative scale.
				[b]Note:[/b] If the basis's scale is the same for every axis, its determinant is always that scale by the power of 2.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_origin" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Vector2" />
			<description>
				Returns this transform's translation. Equivalent to [member origin].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_rotation" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="float" />
			<description>
				Returns this transform's rotation (in radians). This is equivalent to [member x]'s angle (see [method Vector2.angle]).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_scale" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Vector2" />
			<description>
				Returns the length of both [member x] and [member y], as a [Vector2]. If this transform's basis is not skewed, this value is the scaling factor. It is not affected by rotation.
				[codeblocks]
				[gdscript]
				var my_transform = Transform2D(
				    Vector2(2, 0),
				    Vector2(0, 4),
				    Vector2(0, 0)
				)
				# Rotating the Transform2D in any way preserves its scale.
				my_transform = my_transform.rotated(TAU / 2)

				print(my_transform.get_scale()) # Prints (2, 4)
				[/gdscript]
				[csharp]
				var myTransform = new Transform2D(
				    Vector3(2.0f, 0.0f),
				    Vector3(0.0f, 4.0f),
				    Vector3(0.0f, 0.0f)
				);
				// Rotating the Transform2D in any way preserves its scale.
				myTransform = myTransform.Rotated(Mathf.Tau / 2.0f);

				GD.Print(myTransform.GetScale()); // Prints (2, 4)
				[/csharp]
				[/codeblocks]
				[b]Note:[/b] If the value returned by [method determinant] is negative, the scale is also negative.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_skew" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="float" />
			<description>
				Returns this transform's skew (in radians).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="interpolate_with" qualifiers="const">

			<param index="1" name="weight" type="float" />
			<description>
				Returns the result of the linear interpolation between this transform and [param xform] by the given [param weight].
				The [param weight] should be between [code]0.0[/code] and [code]1.0[/code] (inclusive). Values outside this range are allowed and can be used to perform [i]extrapolation[/i] instead.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="inverse" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Transform2D" />
			<description>
				Returns the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix]inverted version of this transform[/url].
				[b]Note:[/b] For this method to return correctly, the transform's basis needs to be [i]orthonormal[/i] (see [method orthonormalized]). That means the basis should only represent a rotation. If it does not, use [method affine_inverse] instead.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_conformal" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if this transform's basis is conformal. A conformal basis is both [i]orthogonal[/i] (the axes are perpendicular to each other) and [i]uniform[/i] (the axes share the same length). This method can be especially useful during physics calculations.
			</description>
		</method>

			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="orthonormalized" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Transform2D" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of this transform with its basis orthonormalized. An orthonormal basis is both [i]orthogonal[/i] (the axes are perpendicular to each other) and [i]normalized[/i] (the axes have a length of [code]1.0[/code]), which also means it can only represent a rotation.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="rotated" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Transform2D" />
			<param index="0" name="angle" type="float" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of this transform rotated by the given [param angle] (in radians).
				If [param angle] is positive, the transform is rotated clockwise.
				This method is an optimized version of multiplying the given transform [code]X[/code] with a corresponding rotation transform [code]R[/code] from the left, i.e., [code]R * X[/code].
				This can be seen as transforming with respect to the global/parent frame.
			</description>

			<return type="Transform2D" />
			<param index="0" name="angle" type="float" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of the transform rotated by the given [param angle] (in radians).
				This method is an optimized version of multiplying the given transform [code]X[/code] with a corresponding rotation transform [code]R[/code] from the right, i.e., [code]X * R[/code].
				This can be seen as transforming with respect to the local frame.

			<return type="Transform2D" />
			<param index="0" name="scale" type="Vector2" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of the transform scaled by the given [param scale] factor.
				This method is an optimized version of multiplying the given transform [code]X[/code] with a corresponding scaling transform [code]S[/code] from the left, i.e., [code]S * X[/code].
				This can be seen as transforming with respect to the global/parent frame.
			</description>
		</method>

			<return type="Transform2D" />
			<param index="0" name="scale" type="Vector2" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of the transform scaled by the given [param scale] factor.
				This method is an optimized version of multiplying the given transform [code]X[/code] with a corresponding scaling transform [code]S[/code] from the right, i.e., [code]X * S[/code].
				This can be seen as transforming with respect to the local frame.

			<return type="Transform2D" />
			<param index="0" name="offset" type="Vector2" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of the transform translated by the given [param offset].
				This method is an optimized version of multiplying the given transform [code]X[/code] with a corresponding translation transform [code]T[/code] from the left, i.e., [code]T * X[/code].
				This can be seen as transforming with respect to the global/parent frame.
			</description>

			<return type="Transform2D" />
			<param index="0" name="offset" type="Vector2" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of the transform translated by the given [param offset].
				This method is an optimized version of multiplying the given transform [code]X[/code] with a corresponding translation transform [code]T[/code] from the right, i.e., [code]X * T[/code].
				This can be seen as transforming with respect to the local frame.
