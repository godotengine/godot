		Omnidirectional light, such as a light bulb or a candle.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		An Omnidirectional light is a type of [Light3D] that emits light in all directions. The light is attenuated by distance and this attenuation can be configured by changing its energy, radius, and attenuation parameters.

			The light's attenuation (drop-off) curve. A number of presets are available in the [b]Inspector[/b] by right-clicking the curve.

			The light's radius. Note that the effectively lit area may appear to be smaller depending on the [member omni_attenuation] in use. No matter the [member omni_attenuation] in use, the light will never reach anything outside this radius.
