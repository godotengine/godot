	<brief_description>
		Abstract base class for viewports. Encapsulates drawing and interaction with a game world.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A [Viewport] creates a different view into the screen, or a sub-view inside another viewport. Child 2D nodes will display on it, and child Camera3D 3D nodes will render on it too.
		Optionally, a viewport can have its own 2D or 3D world, so it doesn't share what it draws with other viewports.
		Viewports can also choose to be audio listeners, so they generate positional audio depending on a 2D or 3D camera child of it.
		Also, viewports can be assigned to different screens in case the devices have multiple screens.
		Finally, viewports can also behave as render targets, in which case they will not be visible unless the associated texture is used to draw.

			<description>
				Returns the automatically computed 2D stretch transform, taking the [Viewport]'s stretch settings into account. The final value is multiplied by [member Window.content_scale_factor], but only for the root viewport. If this method is called on a [SubViewport] (e.g., in a scene tree with [SubViewportContainer] and [SubViewport]), the scale factor of the root window will not be applied. Using [method Transform2D.get_scale] on the returned value, this can be used to compensate for scaling when zooming a [Camera2D] node, or to scale down a [TextureRect] to be pixel-perfect regardless of the automatically computed scale factor.
				[b]Note:[/b] Due to how pixel scaling works, the returned transform's X and Y scale may differ slightly, even when [member Window.content_scale_aspect] is set to a mode that preserves the pixels' aspect ratio. If [member Window.content_scale_aspect] is [constant Window.CONTENT_SCALE_ASPECT_IGNORE], the X and Y scale may differ [i]significantly[/i].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_texture" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="ViewportTexture" />
			<description>
				Returns the viewport's texture.
				[b]Note:[/b] When trying to store the current texture (e.g. in a file), it might be completely black or outdated if used too early, especially when used in e.g. [method Node._ready]. To make sure the texture you get is correct, you can await [signal RenderingServer.frame_post_draw] signal.

				}
				[/csharp]
				[/codeblocks]
				[b]Note:[/b] When [member use_hdr_2d] is [code]true[/code] the returned texture will be an HDR image using linear encoding.

			<description>
				Returns the human-readable description of the drag data, used for assistive apps.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="gui_get_focus_owner" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Control" />

		</method>
		<method name="gui_get_hovered_control" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Control" />
			<description>
				Returns the [Control] that the mouse is currently hovering over in this viewport. If no [Control] has the cursor, returns [code]null[/code].
				Typically the leaf [Control] node or deepest level of the subtree which claims hover. This is very useful when used together with [method Node.is_ancestor_of] to find if the mouse is within a control tree.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="gui_is_drag_successful" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the drag operation is successful.

			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_input_handled" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns whether the current [InputEvent] has been handled. Input events are not handled until [method set_input_as_handled] has been called during the lifetime of an [InputEvent].
				This is usually done as part of input handling methods like [method Node._input], [method Control._gui_input] or others, as well as in corresponding signal handlers.
				If [member handle_input_locally] is set to [code]false[/code], this method will try finding the first parent viewport that is set to handle input locally, and return its value for [method is_input_handled] instead.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="notify_mouse_entered">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Inform the Viewport that the mouse has entered its area. Use this function before sending an [InputEventMouseButton] or [InputEventMouseMotion] to the [Viewport] with [method Viewport.push_input]. See also [method notify_mouse_exited].
				[b]Note:[/b] In most cases, it is not necessary to call this function because [SubViewport] nodes that are children of [SubViewportContainer] are notified automatically. This is only necessary when interacting with viewports in non-default ways, for example as textures in [TextureRect] or with an [Area3D] that forwards input events.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="notify_mouse_exited">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Inform the Viewport that the mouse has left its area. Use this function when the node that displays the viewport notices the mouse has left the area of the displayed viewport. See also [method notify_mouse_entered].
				[b]Note:[/b] In most cases, it is not necessary to call this function because [SubViewport] nodes that are children of [SubViewportContainer] are notified automatically. This is only necessary when interacting with viewports in non-default ways, for example as textures in [TextureRect] or with an [Area3D] that forwards input events.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="push_input">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="event" type="InputEvent" />
			<param index="1" name="in_local_coords" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Triggers the given [param event] in this [Viewport]. This can be used to pass an [InputEvent] between viewports, or to locally apply inputs that were sent over the network or saved to a file.
				If [param in_local_coords] is [code]false[/code], the event's position is in the embedder's coordinates and will be converted to viewport coordinates. If [param in_local_coords] is [code]true[/code], the event's position is in viewport coordinates.
				While this method serves a similar purpose as [method Input.parse_input_event], it does not remap the specified [param event] based on project settings like [member ProjectSettings.input_devices/pointing/emulate_touch_from_mouse].
				Calling this method will propagate calls to child nodes for following methods in the given order:
				- [method Node._input]
				- [method Control._gui_input] for [Control] nodes
				- [method Node._shortcut_input]
				- [method Node._unhandled_key_input]
				- [method Node._unhandled_input]
				If an earlier method marks the input as handled via [method set_input_as_handled], any later method in this list will not be called.
				If none of the methods handle the event and [member physics_object_picking] is [code]true[/code], the event is used for physics object picking.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="push_text_input">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="text" type="String" />
			<description>
				Helper method which calls the [code]set_text()[/code] method on the currently focused [Control], provided that it is defined (e.g. if the focused Control is [Button] or [LineEdit]).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="push_unhandled_input" deprecated="Use [method push_input] instead.">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="event" type="InputEvent" />
			<param index="1" name="in_local_coords" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Triggers the given [param event] in this [Viewport]. This can be used to pass an [InputEvent] between viewports, or to locally apply inputs that were sent over the network or saved to a file.
				If [param in_local_coords] is [code]false[/code], the event's position is in the embedder's coordinates and will be converted to viewport coordinates. If [param in_local_coords] is [code]true[/code], the event's position is in viewport coordinates.
				Calling this method will propagate calls to child nodes for following methods in the given order:
				- [method Node._shortcut_input]
				- [method Node._unhandled_key_input]
				- [method Node._unhandled_input]
				If an earlier method marks the input as handled via [method set_input_as_handled], any later method in this list will not be called.
				If none of the methods handle the event and [member physics_object_picking] is [code]true[/code], the event is used for physics object picking.
				[b]Note:[/b] This method doesn't propagate input events to embedded [Window]s or [SubViewport]s.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_canvas_cull_mask_bit">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="layer" type="int" />
			<param index="1" name="enable" type="bool" />
			<description>
				Set/clear individual bits on the rendering layer mask. This simplifies editing this [Viewport]'s layers.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_input_as_handled">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Stops the input from propagating further up the [SceneTree].
				[b]Note:[/b] This does not affect the methods in [Input], only the way events are propagated.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_positional_shadow_atlas_quadrant_subdiv">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="quadrant" type="int" />
			<param index="1" name="subdiv" type="int" enum="Viewport.PositionalShadowAtlasQuadrantSubdiv" />
			<description>
				Sets the number of subdivisions to use in the specified quadrant. A higher number of subdivisions allows you to have more shadows in the scene at once, but reduces the quality of the shadows. A good practice is to have quadrants with a varying number of subdivisions and to have as few subdivisions as possible.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="update_mouse_cursor_state">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Force instantly updating the display based on the current mouse cursor position. This includes updating the mouse cursor shape and sending necessary [signal Control.mouse_entered], [signal CollisionObject2D.mouse_entered], [signal CollisionObject3D.mouse_entered] and [signal Window.mouse_entered] signals and their respective [code]mouse_exited[/code] counterparts.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="warp_mouse">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="position" type="Vector2" />
			<description>
				Moves the mouse pointer to the specified position in this [Viewport] using the coordinate system of this [Viewport].
				[b]Note:[/b] [method warp_mouse] is only supported on Windows, macOS and Linux. It has no effect on Android, iOS and Web.

		<member name="anisotropic_filtering_level" type="int" setter="set_anisotropic_filtering_level" getter="get_anisotropic_filtering_level" enum="Viewport.AnisotropicFiltering" default="2">
			Sets the maximum number of samples to take when using anisotropic filtering on textures (as a power of two). A higher sample count will result in sharper textures at oblique angles, but is more expensive to compute. A value of [code]0[/code] forcibly disables anisotropic filtering, even on materials where it is enabled.
			The anisotropic filtering level also affects decals and light projectors if they are configured to use anisotropic filtering. See [member ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/decals/filter] and [member ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/light_projectors/filter].
			[b]Note:[/b] In 3D, for this setting to have an effect, set [member BaseMaterial3D.texture_filter] to [constant BaseMaterial3D.TEXTURE_FILTER_LINEAR_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC] or [constant BaseMaterial3D.TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST_WITH_MIPMAPS_ANISOTROPIC] on materials.

See also [member ProjectSettings.rendering/anti_aliasing/quality/msaa_3d] for multi-sample antialiasing, which is significantly cheaper but only smooths the edges of polygons.

			The texture filter blends between the nearest 4 pixels and between the nearest 2 mipmaps (or uses the nearest mipmap if [member ProjectSettings.rendering/textures/default_filters/use_nearest_mipmap_filter] is [code]true[/code]). This makes the texture look smooth from up close, and smooth from a distance.
			Use this for non-pixel art textures that may be viewed at a low scale (e.g. due to [Camera2D] zoom or sprite scaling), as mipmaps are important to smooth out pixels that are smaller than on-screen pixels.

		</constant>
		<constant name="DEFAULT_CANVAS_ITEM_TEXTURE_REPEAT_ENABLED" value="1" enum="DefaultCanvasItemTextureRepeat">
			Enables the texture to repeat when UV coordinates are outside the 0-1 range. If using one of the linear filtering modes, this can result in artifacts at the edges of a texture when the sampler filters across the edges of the texture.
