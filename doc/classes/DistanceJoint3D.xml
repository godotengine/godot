	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A physics constraint which moves two bodies such that their distance is between a minimum and maximum distance. For example, "Body A" can be a [StaticBody3D] representing a ceiling while "Body B" can be a [RigidBody3D] representing a hanging chandelier which can swing when hit.
		[b]Note:[/b] This constraint is only supported by the Jolt Physics engine. To switch to Jolt Physics, set [member ProjectSettings.physics/3d/physics_engine] to [b]Jolt Physics[/b].
