			<description>
				Gets the next [param frames] audio samples from the AudioDevice ring buffer.
				Returns a [PackedVector2Array] containing exactly [param frames] audio samples if available, or an empty [PackedVector2Array] if insufficient data was available.
				The samples are signed floating-point PCM between [code]-1[/code] and [code]1[/code]. You will have to scale them if you want to use them as 8 or 16-bit integer samples. ([code]v = 0x7fff * samples[0].x[/code])
