	<brief_description>
		A 3D physics body that is moved by a physics simulation.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[RigidBody3D] implements full 3D physics. It cannot be controlled directly, instead, you must apply forces to it (gravity, impulses, etc.), and the physics simulation will calculate the resulting movement, rotation, react to collisions, and affect other physics bodies in its path.
		The body's behavior can be adjusted via [member lock_rotation], [member freeze], and [member freeze_mode]. By changing various properties of the object, such as [member mass], you can control how the physics simulation acts on it.
		A rigid body will always maintain its shape and size, even when forces are applied to it. It is useful for objects that can be interacted with in an environment, such as a tree that can be knocked over or a stack of crates that can be pushed around.
		If you need to directly affect the body, prefer [method _integrate_forces] as it allows you to directly access the physics state.
		If you need to override the default physics behavior, you can write a custom force integration function. See [member custom_integrator].
		[b]Note:[/b] Changing the 3D transform or [member linear_velocity] of a [RigidBody3D] very often may lead to some unpredictable behaviors. This also happens when a [RigidBody3D] is the descendant of a constantly moving node, like another [RigidBody3D], as that will cause its global transform to be set whenever its ancestor moves.

			Continuous collision detection tries to predict where a moving body will collide, instead of moving it and correcting its movement if it collided.

		<member name="inertia" type="Vector3" setter="set_inertia" getter="get_inertia" default="Vector3(0, 0, 0)">
			The body's moments of inertia in the local frame. This is like mass, but for rotation: it determines how much torque it takes to rotate the body on each axis. The moment of inertia is usually computed automatically from the mass and the shapes, but this property allows you to set a custom value.
			If set to [constant Vector3.ZERO], inertia is automatically computed (default value).
			In 3D, the rotational inertia of a body is fully represented by a symmetric 3x3 tensor. The [member inertia] property sets the diagonal entries of this tensor while the off-diagonal entries are set by the [member product_of_inertia] property. For more information on the inertia tensor, see the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia#Inertia_tensor]Wikipedia article[/url].

In 3D, the full rotational inertia of an object can be represented by a symmetric 3x3 tensor with 6 unique elements.

When combined with the [member inertia] vector, the local inertia tensor can be fully defined. For most applications, the products of inertia can be left as [constant Vector3.ZERO]. For more information on the inertia tensor, see the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia#Inertia_tensor]Wikipedia article[/url].
			If [member inertia] is set to [constant Vector3.ZERO], the body's entire inertia will be computed automatically, and the value set here will be ignored.
