	<brief_description>
		A 3D physics body that is moved by a physics simulation.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[RigidBody3D] implements full 3D physics. It cannot be controlled directly, instead, you must apply forces to it (gravity, impulses, etc.), and the physics simulation will calculate the resulting movement, rotation, react to collisions, and affect other physics bodies in its path.
		The body's behavior can be adjusted via [member lock_rotation], [member freeze], and [member freeze_mode]. By changing various properties of the object, such as [member mass], you can control how the physics simulation acts on it.
		A rigid body will always maintain its shape and size, even when forces are applied to it. It is useful for objects that can be interacted with in an environment, such as a tree that can be knocked over or a stack of crates that can be pushed around.
		If you need to override the default physics behavior, you can write a custom force integration function. See [member custom_integrator].
		[b]Note:[/b] Changing the 3D transform or [member linear_velocity] of a [RigidBody3D] very often may lead to some unpredictable behaviors. If you need to directly affect the body, prefer [method _integrate_forces] as it allows you to directly access the physics state.

		<method name="_integrate_forces" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="state" type="PhysicsDirectBodyState3D" />
			<description>
				Called during physics processing, allowing you to read and safely modify the simulation state for the object. By default, it works in addition to the usual physics behavior, but the [member custom_integrator] property allows you to disable the default behavior and do fully custom force integration for a body.

		</method>
		<method name="add_constant_central_force">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="force" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Adds a constant directional force without affecting rotation that keeps being applied over time until cleared with [code]constant_force = Vector3(0, 0, 0)[/code].
				This is equivalent to using [method add_constant_force] at the body's center of mass.

			<description>
				Adds a constant positioned force to the body that keeps being applied over time until cleared with [code]constant_force = Vector3(0, 0, 0)[/code].

		</method>
		<method name="apply_central_force">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="force" type="Vector3" />

			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="impulse" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Applies a directional impulse without affecting rotation.
				An impulse is time-independent! Applying an impulse every frame would result in a framerate-dependent force. For this reason, it should only be used when simulating one-time impacts (use the "_force" functions otherwise).
				This is equivalent to using [method apply_impulse] at the body's center of mass.

				Applies a rotational force without affecting position. A force is time dependent and meant to be applied every physics update.

				Returns a list of the bodies colliding with this one. Requires [member contact_monitor] to be set to [code]true[/code] and [member max_contacts_reported] to be set high enough to detect all the collisions.
				[b]Note:[/b] The result of this test is not immediate after moving objects. For performance, list of collisions is updated once per frame and before the physics step. Consider using signals instead.

		<method name="get_inverse_inertia_tensor" qualifiers="const">

			The body's custom center of mass, relative to the body's origin position, when [member center_of_mass_mode] is set to [constant CENTER_OF_MASS_MODE_CUSTOM]. This is the balanced point of the body, where applied forces only cause linear acceleration. Applying forces outside of the center of mass causes angular acceleration.

			If [code]true[/code], continuous collision detection is used.
			Continuous collision detection tries to predict where a moving body will collide, instead of moving it and correcting its movement if it collided. Continuous collision detection is more precise, and misses fewer impacts by small, fast-moving objects. Not using continuous collision detection is faster to compute, but can miss small, fast-moving objects.

			The body's moment of inertia. This is like mass, but for rotation: it determines how much torque it takes to rotate the body on each axis. The moment of inertia is usually computed automatically from the mass and the shapes, but this property allows you to set a custom value.
