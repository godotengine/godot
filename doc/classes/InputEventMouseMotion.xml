	<brief_description>
		Represents a mouse or a pen movement.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Stores information about a mouse or a pen motion. This includes relative position, absolute position, and velocity. See [method Node._input].
		[b]Note:[/b] By default, this event is only emitted once per frame rendered at most. If you need more precise input reporting, set [member Input.use_accumulated_input] to [code]false[/code] to make events emitted as often as possible. If you use InputEventMouseMotion to draw lines, consider implementing [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm]Bresenham's line algorithm[/url] as well to avoid visible gaps in lines if the user is moving the mouse quickly.
		[b]Note:[/b] This event may be emitted even when the mouse hasn't moved, either by the operating system or by Godot itself. If you really need to know if the mouse has moved (e.g. to suppress displaying a tooltip), you should check that [code]relative.is_zero_approx()[/code] is [code]false[/code].

		<member name="pen_inverted" type="bool" setter="set_pen_inverted" getter="get_pen_inverted" default="false">
			Returns [code]true[/code] when using the eraser end of a stylus pen.
			[b]Note:[/b] This property is implemented on Linux, macOS and Windows.
		</member>
		<member name="pressure" type="float" setter="set_pressure" getter="get_pressure" default="0.0">
			Represents the pressure the user puts on the pen. Ranges from [code]0.0[/code] to [code]1.0[/code].
		</member>
		<member name="relative" type="Vector2" setter="set_relative" getter="get_relative" default="Vector2(0, 0)">
			The mouse position relative to the previous position (position at the last frame).
			[b]Note:[/b] Since [InputEventMouseMotion] may only be emitted when the mouse moves, it is not possible to reliably detect when the mouse has stopped moving by checking this property. A separate, short timer may be necessary.
			[b]Note:[/b] [member relative] is automatically scaled according to the content scale factor, which is defined by the project's stretch mode settings. This means mouse sensitivity will appear different depending on resolution when using [member relative] in a script that handles mouse aiming with the [constant Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED] mouse mode. To avoid this, use [member screen_relative] instead.
		</member>
		<member name="screen_relative" type="Vector2" setter="set_screen_relative" getter="get_screen_relative" default="Vector2(0, 0)">
			The unscaled mouse position relative to the previous position in the coordinate system of the screen (position at the last frame).
			[b]Note:[/b] Since [InputEventMouseMotion] may only be emitted when the mouse moves, it is not possible to reliably detect when the mouse has stopped moving by checking this property. A separate, short timer may be necessary.
			[b]Note:[/b] This coordinate is [i]not[/i] scaled according to the content scale factor or calls to [method InputEvent.xformed_by]. This should be preferred over [member relative] for mouse aiming when using the [constant Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED] mouse mode, regardless of the project's stretch mode.
		</member>
		<member name="screen_velocity" type="Vector2" setter="set_screen_velocity" getter="get_screen_velocity" default="Vector2(0, 0)">
			The unscaled mouse velocity in pixels per second in screen coordinates. This velocity is [i]not[/i] scaled according to the content scale factor or calls to [method InputEvent.xformed_by]. This should be preferred over [member velocity] for mouse aiming when using the [constant Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED] mouse mode, regardless of the project's stretch mode.
		</member>
		<member name="tilt" type="Vector2" setter="set_tilt" getter="get_tilt" default="Vector2(0, 0)">
			Represents the angles of tilt of the pen. Positive X-coordinate value indicates a tilt to the right. Positive Y-coordinate value indicates a tilt toward the user. Ranges from [code]-1.0[/code] to [code]1.0[/code] for both axes.
		</member>
		<member name="velocity" type="Vector2" setter="set_velocity" getter="get_velocity" default="Vector2(0, 0)">
			The mouse velocity in pixels per second.
			[b]Note:[/b] [member velocity] is automatically scaled according to the content scale factor, which is defined by the project's stretch mode settings. This means mouse sensitivity will appear different depending on resolution when using [member velocity] in a script that handles mouse aiming with the [constant Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED] mouse mode. To avoid this, use [member screen_velocity] instead.
