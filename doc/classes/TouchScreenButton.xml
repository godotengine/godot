		Button for touch screen devices for gameplay use.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		TouchScreenButton allows you to create on-screen buttons for touch devices. It's intended for gameplay use, such as a unit you have to touch to move. Unlike [Button], TouchScreenButton supports multitouch out of the box. Several TouchScreenButtons can be pressed at the same time with touch input.
		This node inherits from [Node2D]. Unlike with [Control] nodes, you cannot set anchors on it. If you want to create menus or user interfaces, you may want to use [Button] nodes instead. To make button nodes react to touch events, you can enable [member ProjectSettings.input_devices/pointing/emulate_mouse_from_touch] in the Project Settings.
		You can configure TouchScreenButton to be visible only on touch devices, helping you develop your game both for desktop and mobile devices.
