		Contains a [Curve2D] path for [PathFollow2D] nodes to follow.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Can have [PathFollow2D] child-nodes moving along the [Curve2D]. See [PathFollow2D] for more information on this usage.
		Note that the path is considered as relative to the moved nodes (children of [PathFollow2D]) - usually the curve should start with a zero vector (0, 0).
