		A resource to add to an [AnimationNodeBlendTree]. Blends two animations out of three additively out of three based on the amount value.
		This animation node has three inputs:
		- The base animation to add to
		- A "-add" animation to blend with when the blend amount is negative
		- A "+add" animation to blend with when the blend amount is positive
		If the absolute value of the amount is greater than [code]1.0[/code], the animation connected to "in" port is blended with the amplified animation connected to "-add"/"+add" port.
