		Triangle geometry for efficient, physicsless intersection queries.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Creates a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) tree structure around triangle geometry.
		The triangle BVH tree can be used for efficient intersection queries without involving a physics engine.
		For example, this can be used in editor tools to select objects with complex shapes based on the mouse cursor position.
		[b]Performance:[/b] Creating the BVH tree for complex geometry is a slow process and best done in a background thread.

	<methods>
		<method name="create_from_faces">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="faces" type="PackedVector3Array" />
			<description>
				Creates the BVH tree from an array of faces. Each 3 vertices of the input [param faces] array represent one triangle (face).
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the tree is successfully built, [code]false[/code] otherwise.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_faces" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="PackedVector3Array" />
			<description>
				Returns a copy of the geometry faces. Each 3 vertices of the array represent one triangle (face).

		<method name="intersect_ray" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Dictionary" />
			<param index="0" name="begin" type="Vector3" />
			<param index="1" name="dir" type="Vector3" />
			<description>
				Tests for intersection with a ray starting at [param begin] and facing [param dir] and extending toward infinity.
				If an intersection with a triangle happens, returns a [Dictionary] with the following fields:
				[code]position[/code]: The position on the intersected triangle.
				[code]normal[/code]: The normal of the intersected triangle.
				[code]face_index[/code]: The index of the intersected triangle.
				Returns an empty [Dictionary] if no intersection happens.
				See also [method intersect_segment], which is similar but uses a finite-length segment.

			<description>
				Tests for intersection with a segment going from [param begin] to [param end].
				If an intersection with a triangle happens returns a [Dictionary] with the following fields:
				[code]position[/code]: The position on the intersected triangle.
				[code]normal[/code]: The normal of the intersected triangle.
				[code]face_index[/code]: The index of the intersected triangle.
				Returns an empty [Dictionary] if no intersection happens.
