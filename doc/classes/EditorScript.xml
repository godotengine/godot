	<brief_description>
		Base script that can be used to add extension functions to the editor.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Scripts extending this class and implementing its [method _run] method can be executed from the Script Editor's [b]File &gt; Run[/b] menu option (or by pressing [kbd]Ctrl + Shift + X[/kbd]) while the editor is running. This is useful for adding custom in-editor functionality to Godot. For more complex additions, consider using [EditorPlugin]s instead.
		[b]Note:[/b] Extending scripts need to have [code]tool[/code] mode enabled.
		[b]Example script:[/b]
		[codeblocks]
		[gdscript]
		@tool
		extends EditorScript

		func _run():
		    print("Hello from the Godot Editor!")
		[/gdscript]
		[csharp]
		using Godot;

		[Tool]
		public partial class HelloEditor : EditorScript
		{
		    public override void _Run()
		    {
		        GD.Print("Hello from the Godot Editor!");
		    }
		}
		[/csharp]
		[/codeblocks]
		[b]Note:[/b] The script is run in the Editor context, which means the output is visible in the console window started with the Editor (stdout) instead of the usual Godot [b]Output[/b] dock.
		[b]Note:[/b] EditorScript is [RefCounted], meaning it is destroyed when nothing references it. This can cause errors during asynchronous operations if there are no references to the script.
