		Audio effect used for recording the audio that passes through it.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Allows the user to record the sound passing through the effect into an [AudioStreamWAV]. When used on the "Master" audio bus, this includes all audio output by Godot.
		Unlike [AudioEffectCapture], this effect encodes the recording with the given format (8-bit, 16-bit, or compressed) instead of giving access to the raw audio samples.
		Can be used (with an [AudioStreamMicrophone]) to record from a microphone.
		[b]Note:[/b] [member ProjectSettings.audio/driver/enable_input] must be [code]true[/code] for audio input to work. See also that setting's description for caveats related to permissions and operating system privacy settings.
