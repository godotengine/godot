		Container and player of [Animation] resources.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		An animation player is used for general-purpose playback of [Animation] resources. It contains a dictionary of animations (referenced by name) and custom blend times between their transitions. Additionally, animations can be played and blended in different channels.
		[AnimationPlayer] is more suited than [Tween] for animations where you know the final values in advance. For example, fading a screen in and out is more easily done with an [AnimationPlayer] node thanks to the animation tools provided by the editor. That particular example can also be implemented with a [Tween] node, but it requires doing everything by code.
		Updating the target properties of animations occurs at process time.

			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="clear_caches">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>

			<return type="Animation" />
			<argument index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the [Animation] with key [code]name[/code] or [code]null[/code] if not found.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_animation_list" qualifiers="const">

			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_playing_speed" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="float" />
			<description>
				Gets the actual playing speed of current animation or 0 if not playing. This speed is the [member playback_speed] property multiplied by [code]custom_speed[/code] argument specified when calling the [method play] method.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_queue">
			<return type="PoolStringArray" />
			<description>
				Returns a list of the animation names that are currently queued to play.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="has_animation" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<argument index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the [AnimationPlayer] stores an [Animation] with key [code]name[/code].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_playing" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if playing an animation.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="play">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="name" type="String" default="&quot;&quot;" />
			<argument index="1" name="custom_blend" type="float" default="-1" />
			<argument index="2" name="custom_speed" type="float" default="1.0" />
			<argument index="3" name="from_end" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Plays the animation with key [code]name[/code]. Custom blend times and speed can be set. If [code]custom_speed[/code] is negative and [code]from_end[/code] is [code]true[/code], the animation will play backwards (which is equivalent to calling [method play_backwards]).
				The [AnimationPlayer] keeps track of its current or last played animation with [member assigned_animation]. If this method is called with that same animation [code]name[/code], or with no [code]name[/code] parameter, the assigned animation will resume playing if it was paused, or restart if it was stopped (see [method stop] for both pause and stop). If the animation was already playing, it will keep playing.
				[b]Note:[/b] The animation will be updated the next time the [AnimationPlayer] is processed. If other variables are updated at the same time this is called, they may be updated too early. To perform the update immediately, call [code]advance(0)[/code].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="play_backwards">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="name" type="String" default="&quot;&quot;" />
			<argument index="1" name="custom_blend" type="float" default="-1" />
			<description>
				Plays the animation with key [code]name[/code] in reverse.
				This method is a shorthand for [method play] with [code]custom_speed = -1.0[/code] and [code]from_end = true[/code], so see its description for more information.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="queue">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<description>
				Queues an animation for playback once the current one is done.
				[b]Note:[/b] If a looped animation is currently playing, the queued animation will never play unless the looped animation is stopped somehow.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="remove_animation">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<description>
				Removes the animation with key [code]name[/code].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="rename_animation">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<argument index="1" name="newname" type="String" />
			<description>
				Renames an existing animation with key [code]name[/code] to [code]newname[/code].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="seek">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="seconds" type="float" />
			<argument index="1" name="update" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Seeks the animation to the [code]seconds[/code] point in time (in seconds). If [code]update[/code] is [code]true[/code], the animation updates too, otherwise it updates at process time. Events between the current frame and [code]seconds[/code] are skipped.
				[b]Note:[/b] Seeking to the end of the animation doesn't emit [signal animation_finished]. If you want to skip animation and emit the signal, use [method advance].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_blend_time">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="anim_from" type="String" />
			<argument index="1" name="anim_to" type="String" />
			<argument index="2" name="sec" type="float" />
			<description>
				Specifies a blend time (in seconds) between two animations, referenced by their names.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="stop">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="reset" type="bool" default="true" />
			<description>
				Stops or pauses the currently playing animation. If [code]reset[/code] is [code]true[/code], the animation position is reset to [code]0[/code] and the playback speed is reset to [code]1.0[/code].
				If [code]reset[/code] is [code]false[/code], the [member current_animation_position] will be kept and calling [method play] or [method play_backwards] without arguments or with the same animation name as [member assigned_animation] will resume the animation.
