	<description>
		A box-shaped attractor with varying directions and strengths defined in it that influences particles from [GPUParticles3D] nodes.
		Unlike [GPUParticlesAttractorBox3D], [GPUParticlesAttractorVectorField3D] uses a [member texture] to affect attraction strength within the box. This can be used to create complex attraction scenarios where particles travel in different directions depending on their location. This can be useful for weather effects such as sandstorms.
		Particle attractors work in real-time and can be moved, rotated and scaled during gameplay. Unlike collision shapes, non-uniform scaling of attractors is also supported.
		[b]Note:[/b] Particle attractors only affect [GPUParticles3D], not [CPUParticles3D].

			The 3D texture to be used. Values are linearly interpolated between the texture's pixels.
			Each color channel affects one axis: red for the local X axis, green for the local Y axis, blue for the local Z axis. The texture's alpha channel is ignored. A color of [code]Color(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)[/code] (50% gray) is considered to be a "neutral" value with no influence on any axis. Assuming the [GPUParticlesAttractor3D]'s strength is positive, a pure white color ([code]Color(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)[/code]) attracts particles towards local +X, +Y and +Z, while a pure black color ([code]Color(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)[/code]) attracts particles towards local -X, -Y and -Z.
			[b]Note:[/b] To get better performance, the 3D texture's resolution should reflect the [member size] of the attractor. Since particle attraction is usually low-frequency data, the texture can be kept at a low resolution such as 64×64×64.
			[b]Tip:[/b] [NoiseTexture3D] with a color ramp assigned ([member NoiseTexture3D.color_ramp]) can be useful for procedurally generated vector fields.
