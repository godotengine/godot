		A CSG convex hull shape.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This node creates a mesh based on the convex hull of a set of points for use with the CSG system.
		[b]Note:[/b] CSG nodes are intended to be used for level prototyping. Creating CSG nodes has a significant CPU cost compared to creating a [MeshInstance3D] with a [PrimitiveMesh]. Moving a CSG node within another CSG node also has a significant CPU cost, so it should be avoided during gameplay.
