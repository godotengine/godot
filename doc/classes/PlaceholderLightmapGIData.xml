		Placeholder class for [LightmapGIData].
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This class is used when loading a project that uses a [LightmapGIData] subclass, if the project was exported in dedicated server mode. In this mode, only the resource reference is kept, with no actual light probe data. This allows reducing the exported PCK's size significantly.
		[b]Note:[/b] This is not intended to be used as an actual resource for rendering.
