	<description>
		An audio effect instance manipulates the audio it receives for a given effect. This instance is automatically created by an [AudioEffect] when it is added to a bus or added to an [AudioStreamWithEffects] with active playbacks, and should usually not be created directly. If necessary, bus effect instances can be fetched at run-time with [method AudioServer.get_bus_effect_instance].

				Called by the [AudioServer] to process this effect. When [method _process_silence] is not overridden or it returns [code]false[/code], this method is called only when the bus is active.
				[b]Note:[/b] It is not useful to override this method in GDScript or C#. Only GDExtension can take advantage of it.

				Override this method to customize the processing behavior of this effect instance.
				Should return [code]true[/code] to force the [AudioServer] to always call [method _process], even if the bus has been muted or cannot otherwise be heard.
