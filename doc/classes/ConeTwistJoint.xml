		A twist joint between two 3D bodies
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The joint can rotate the bodies across an axis defined by the local x-axes of the [Joint].
		The twist axis is initiated as the x-axis of the [Joint].
		Once the Bodies swing, the twist axis is calculated as the middle of the x-axes of the Joint in the local space of the two Bodies.
