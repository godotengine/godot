		One-shot timer.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A one-shot timer managed by the scene tree, which emits [signal timeout] on completion. See also [method SceneTree.create_timer].
		As opposed to [Timer], it does not require the instantiation of a node. Commonly used to create a one-shot delay timer as in the following example:
		[codeblock]
		func some_function():
		    print("Timer started.")
		    yield(get_tree().create_timer(1.0), "timeout")
		    print("Timer ended.")
		[/codeblock]
		The timer will be dereferenced after its time elapses. To preserve the timer, you can keep a reference to it. See [Reference].
