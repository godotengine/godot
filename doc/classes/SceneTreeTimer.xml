		One-shot timer.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A one-shot timer managed by the scene tree, which emits [signal timeout] on completion. See also [method SceneTree.create_timer].
		As opposed to [Timer], it does not require the instantiation of a node. Commonly used to create a one-shot delay timer as in the following example:
		[codeblocks]
		[gdscript]
		func some_function():
			print("Timer started.")
			await get_tree().create_timer(1.0).timeout
			print("Timer ended.")
		[/gdscript]
		[csharp]
		public async Task SomeFunction()
		{
			GD.Print("Timer started.");
			await ToSignal(GetTree().CreateTimer(1.0f), SceneTreeTimer.SignalName.Timeout);
			GD.Print("Timer ended.");
		}
		[/csharp]
		[/codeblocks]
		The timer will be dereferenced after its time elapses. To preserve the timer, you can keep a reference to it. See [RefCounted].
		[b]Note:[/b] The timer is processed after all of the nodes in the current frame, i.e. node's [method Node._process] method would be called before the timer (or [method Node._physics_process] if [code]process_in_physics[/code] in [method SceneTree.create_timer] has been set to [code]true[/code]).
