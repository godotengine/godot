	<brief_description>
		A physics joint that allows for complex movement and rotation between two 3D physics bodies.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The [Generic6DOFJoint3D] (6 Degrees Of Freedom) joint allows for implementing custom types of joints by locking the rotation and translation of certain axes.
		The first 3 DOF represent the linear motion of the physics bodies and the last 3 DOF represent the angular motion of the physics bodies. Each axis can be either locked, or limited.
