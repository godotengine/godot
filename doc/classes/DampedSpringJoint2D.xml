	<description>
		A physics joint that connects two 2D physics bodies with a spring-like force. This resembles a spring that always wants to stretch to a given length.
		The joint will connect to [member Joint2D.node_a] at the joint's global position, and will attach to [member Joint2D.node_b] at the point [member length] units away in the local +Y axis.

		<member name="damping" type="float" setter="set_damping" getter="get_damping" default="1.0">
			The spring joint's damping ratio. A value between [code]0[/code] and [code]1[/code]. When the two bodies move into different directions the system tries to align them to the spring axis again. A high [member damping] value forces the attached bodies to align faster.
		</member>
		<member name="length" type="float" setter="set_length" getter="get_length" default="50.0">
			The spring joint's initial length. This, along with [member Node2D.rotation], defines where [member Joint2D.node_b] will be attached to.
		</member>
		<member name="rest_length" type="float" setter="set_rest_length" getter="get_rest_length" default="0.0">
			When the bodies attached to the spring joint move they stretch or squash it. The joint always tries to resize towards its [member rest_length]. If set to 0, it will instead be set to [member length].
		</member>
		<member name="stiffness" type="float" setter="set_stiffness" getter="get_stiffness" default="20.0">
			The higher the value, the harder the spring joint will pull towards its [member rest_length]. The joint applies an opposing force to the bodies, the product of the [member stiffness] multiplied by the size difference from its resting length.
