			The force with which the pinned objects stay in positional relation to each other. The higher, the stronger.

		<member name="params/damping" type="float" setter="set_param" getter="get_param" default="1.0">
			The amount of damping applied to linear velocity. It is measured in N·s/m, or kg/s in SI base units.
			Higher linear damping results in a more gradual reduction in linear velocity, creating smoother, gentler behavior as the joint returns to its limit, preventing oscillations or rapid movement. Lower values make the joint more elastic or bouncy.
