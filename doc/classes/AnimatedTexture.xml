		Proxy texture for simple frame-based animations.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[AnimatedTexture] is a resource format for frame-based animations, where multiple textures can be chained automatically with a predefined delay for each frame. Unlike [AnimationPlayer] or [AnimatedSprite2D], it isn't a [Node], but has the advantage of being usable anywhere a [Texture2D] resource can be used, e.g. in a [TileSet].
		The playback of the animation is controlled by the [member speed_scale] property, as well as each frame's duration (see [method set_frame_duration]). The animation loops, i.e. it will restart at frame 0 automatically after playing the last frame.
		[AnimatedTexture] currently requires all frame textures to have the same size, otherwise the bigger ones will be cropped to match the smallest one.
		[b]Note:[/b] AnimatedTexture doesn't support using [AtlasTexture]s. Each frame needs to be a separate [Texture2D].
		[b]Warning:[/b] The current implementation is not efficient for the modern renderers.
		[i]Deprecated.[/i] This class is deprecated, and might be removed in a future release.

				Sets the duration of any given [param frame]. The final duration is affected by the [member speed_scale]. If set to [code]0[/code], the frame is skipped during playback.

			<description>
				Assigns a [Texture2D] to the given frame. Frame IDs start at 0, so the first frame has ID 0, and the last frame of the animation has ID [member frames] - 1.
				You can define any number of textures up to [constant MAX_FRAMES], but keep in mind that only frames from 0 to [member frames] - 1 will be part of the animation.

		<member name="current_frame" type="int" setter="set_current_frame" getter="get_current_frame">
			Sets the currently visible frame of the texture. Setting this frame while playing resets the current frame time, so the newly selected frame plays for its whole configured frame duration.
		</member>
		<member name="frames" type="int" setter="set_frames" getter="get_frames" default="1">
			Number of frames to use in the animation. While you can create the frames independently with [method set_frame_texture], you need to set this value for the animation to take new frames into account. The maximum number of frames is [constant MAX_FRAMES].

		<member name="one_shot" type="bool" setter="set_one_shot" getter="get_one_shot" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], the animation will only play once and will not loop back to the first frame after reaching the end. Note that reaching the end will not set [member pause] to [code]true[/code].
		</member>
		<member name="pause" type="bool" setter="set_pause" getter="get_pause" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], the animation will pause where it currently is (i.e. at [member current_frame]). The animation will continue from where it was paused when changing this property to [code]false[/code].
