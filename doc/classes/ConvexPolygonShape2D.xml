	<brief_description>
		A 2D convex polygon shape used for physics collision.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A 2D convex polygon shape, intended for use in physics. Used internally in [CollisionPolygon2D] when it's in [constant CollisionPolygon2D.BUILD_SOLIDS] mode.
		[ConvexPolygonShape2D] is [i]solid[/i], which means it detects collisions from objects that are fully inside it, unlike [ConcavePolygonShape2D] which is hollow. This makes it more suitable for both detection and physics.
		[b]Convex decomposition:[/b] A concave polygon can be split up into several convex polygons. This allows dynamic physics bodies to have complex concave collisions (at a performance cost) and can be achieved by using several [ConvexPolygonShape2D] nodes or by using the [CollisionPolygon2D] node in [constant CollisionPolygon2D.BUILD_SOLIDS] mode. To generate a collision polygon from a sprite, select the [Sprite2D] node, go to the [b]Sprite2D[/b] menu that appears above the viewport, and choose [b]Create Polygon2D Sibling[/b].
		[b]Performance:[/b] [ConvexPolygonShape2D] is faster to check collisions against compared to [ConcavePolygonShape2D], but it is slower than primitive collision shapes such as [CircleShape2D] and [RectangleShape2D]. Its use should generally be limited to medium-sized objects that cannot have their collision accurately represented by primitive shapes.

				Based on the set of points provided, this assigns the [member points] property using the convex hull algorithm, removing all unneeded points. See [method Geometry2D.convex_hull] for details.

			The polygon's list of vertices that form a convex hull. Can be in either clockwise or counterclockwise order.
			[b]Warning:[/b] Only set this property to a list of points that actually form a convex hull. Use [method set_point_cloud] to generate the convex hull of an arbitrary set of points.
