	<brief_description>
		A control used to edit properties of an object.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This is the control that implements property editing in the editor's Settings dialogs, the Inspector dock, etc. To get the [EditorInspector] used in the editor's Inspector dock, use [method EditorInterface.get_inspector].
		[EditorInspector] will show properties in the same order as the array returned by [method Object.get_property_list].
		If a property's name is path-like (i.e. if it contains forward slashes), [EditorInspector] will create nested sections for "directories" along the path. For example, if a property is named [code]highlighting/gdscript/node_path_color[/code], it will be shown as "Node Path Color" inside the "GDScript" section nested inside the "Highlighting" section.
		If a property has [constant PROPERTY_USAGE_GROUP] usage, it will group subsequent properties whose name starts with the property's hint string. The group ends when a property does not start with that hint string or when a new group starts. An empty group name effectively ends the current group. [EditorInspector] will create a top-level section for each group. For example, if a property with group usage is named [code]Collide With[/code] and its hint string is [code]collide_with_[/code], a subsequent [code]collide_with_area[/code] property will be shown as "Area" inside the "Collide With" section. There is also a special case: when the hint string contains the name of a property, that property is grouped too. This is mainly to help grouping properties like [code]font[/code], [code]font_color[/code] and [code]font_size[/code] (using the hint string [code]font_[/code]).
		If a property has [constant PROPERTY_USAGE_SUBGROUP] usage, a subgroup will be created in the same way as a group, and a second-level section will be created for each subgroup.
		[b]Note:[/b] Unlike sections created from path-like property names, [EditorInspector] won't capitalize the name for sections created from groups. So properties with group usage usually use capitalized names instead of snake_cased names.

			<param index="1" name="value" type="Variant" />
			<param index="2" name="advance" type="bool" />
			<description>
				Emitted when a property is keyed in the inspector. Properties can be keyed by clicking the "key" icon next to a property when the Animation panel is toggled.
			</description>

			<description>
				Emitted when a boolean property is toggled in the inspector.
