	<brief_description>
		A tab used to edit properties of the selected node.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The editor inspector is by default located on the right-hand side of the editor. It's used to edit the properties of the selected node. For example, you can select a node such as [Sprite] then edit its transform through the inspector tool. The editor inspector is an essential tool in the game development workflow.
		[b]Note:[/b] This class shouldn't be instantiated directly. Instead, access the singleton using [method EditorInterface.get_inspector].
