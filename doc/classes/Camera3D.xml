		Camera node, displays from a point of view.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[Camera3D] is a special node that displays what is visible from its current location. Cameras register themselves in the nearest [Viewport] node (when ascending the tree). Only one camera can be active per viewport. If no viewport is available ascending the tree, the camera will register in the global viewport. In other words, a camera just provides 3D display capabilities to a [Viewport], and, without one, a scene registered in that [Viewport] (or higher viewports) can't be displayed.

			The [Compositor] to use for this camera.

		<member name="cull_mask" type="int" setter="set_cull_mask" getter="get_cull_mask" default="1048575">
			The culling mask that describes which [member VisualInstance3D.layers] are rendered by this camera. By default, all 20 user-visible layers are rendered.
			[b]Note:[/b] Since the [member cull_mask] allows for 32 layers to be stored in total, there are an additional 12 layers that are only used internally by the engine and aren't exposed in the editor. Setting [member cull_mask] using a script allows you to toggle those reserved layers, which can be useful for editor plugins.
			To adjust [member cull_mask] more easily using a script, use [method get_cull_mask_value] and [method set_cull_mask_value].
			[b]Note:[/b] [VoxelGI], SDFGI and [LightmapGI] will always take all layers into account to determine what contributes to global illumination. If this is an issue, set [member GeometryInstance3D.gi_mode] to [constant GeometryInstance3D.GI_MODE_DISABLED] for meshes and [member Light3D.light_bake_mode] to [constant Light3D.BAKE_DISABLED] for lights to exclude them from global illumination.

			If [code]true[/code], the ancestor [Viewport] is currently using this camera.
			If multiple cameras are in the scene, one will always be made current. For example, if two [Camera3D] nodes are present in the scene and only one is current, setting one camera's [member current] to [code]false[/code] will cause the other camera to be made current.

			The camera's field of view angle (in degrees). Only applicable in perspective mode. Since [member keep_aspect] locks one axis, [member fov] sets the other axis' field of view angle.
			For reference, the default vertical field of view value ([code]75.0[/code]) is equivalent to a horizontal FOV of:
			- ~91.31 degrees in a 4:3 viewport
