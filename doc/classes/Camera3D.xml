		Camera node, displays from a point of view.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[Camera3D] is a special node that displays what is visible from its current location. Cameras register themselves in the nearest [Viewport] node (when ascending the tree). Only one camera can be active per viewport. If no viewport is available ascending the tree, the camera will register in the global viewport. In other words, a camera just provides 3D display capabilities to a [Viewport], and, without one, a scene registered in that [Viewport] (or higher viewports) can't be displayed.

				# This code block is part of a script that inherits from Node3D.
				# `control` is a reference to a node inheriting from Control.
				control.visible = not get_viewport().get_camera_3d().is_position_behind(global_transform.origin)

	<members>
		<member name="attributes" type="CameraAttributes" setter="set_attributes" getter="get_attributes">
			The [CameraAttributes] to use for this camera.
		</member>
		<member name="cull_mask" type="int" setter="set_cull_mask" getter="get_cull_mask" default="1048575">
			The culling mask that describes which [member VisualInstance3D.layers] are rendered by this camera. By default, all 20 user-visible layers are rendered.
			[b]Note:[/b] Since the [member cull_mask] allows for 32 layers to be stored in total, there are an additional 12 layers that are only used internally by the engine and aren't exposed in the editor. Setting [member cull_mask] using a script allows you to toggle those reserved layers, which can be useful for editor plugins.
			To adjust [member cull_mask] more easily using a script, use [method get_cull_mask_value] and [method set_cull_mask_value].
			[b]Note:[/b] [VoxelGI], SDFGI and [LightmapGI] will always take all layers into account to determine what contributes to global illumination. If this is an issue, set [member GeometryInstance3D.gi_mode] to [constant GeometryInstance3D.GI_MODE_DISABLED] for meshes and [member Light3D.light_bake_mode] to [constant Light3D.BAKE_DISABLED] for lights to exclude them from global illumination.
		</member>
		<member name="current" type="bool" setter="set_current" getter="is_current" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], the ancestor [Viewport] is currently using this camera.
			If multiple cameras are in the scene, one will always be made current. For example, if two [Camera3D] nodes are present in the scene and only one is current, setting one camera's [member current] to [code]false[/code] will cause the other camera to be made current.
		</member>
		<member name="doppler_tracking" type="int" setter="set_doppler_tracking" getter="get_doppler_tracking" enum="Camera3D.DopplerTracking" default="0">
			If not [constant DOPPLER_TRACKING_DISABLED], this camera will simulate the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect]Doppler effect[/url] for objects changed in particular [code]_process[/code] methods. See [enum DopplerTracking] for possible values.
		</member>
		<member name="environment" type="Environment" setter="set_environment" getter="get_environment">
			The [Environment] to use for this camera.
		</member>
		<member name="far" type="float" setter="set_far" getter="get_far" default="4000.0">
			The distance to the far culling boundary for this camera relative to its local Z axis. Higher values allow the camera to see further away, while decreasing [member far] can improve performance if it results in objects being partially or fully culled.
		</member>
		<member name="fov" type="float" setter="set_fov" getter="get_fov" default="75.0">
			The camera's field of view angle (in degrees). Only applicable in perspective mode. Since [member keep_aspect] locks one axis, [member fov] sets the other axis' field of view angle.
			For reference, the default vertical field of view value ([code]75.0[/code]) is equivalent to a horizontal FOV of:
			- ~91.31 degrees in a 4:3 viewport
			- ~101.67 degrees in a 16:10 viewport
			- ~107.51 degrees in a 16:9 viewport

		<member name="frustum_offset" type="Vector2" setter="set_frustum_offset" getter="get_frustum_offset" default="Vector2(0, 0)">
			The camera's frustum offset. This can be changed from the default to create "tilted frustum" effects such as [url=https://zdoom.org/wiki/Y-shearing]Y-shearing[/url].
			[b]Note:[/b] Only effective if [member projection] is [constant PROJECTION_FRUSTUM].
		</member>
		<member name="h_offset" type="float" setter="set_h_offset" getter="get_h_offset" default="0.0">
			The horizontal (X) offset of the camera viewport.

		</member>
		<member name="near" type="float" setter="set_near" getter="get_near" default="0.05">
			The distance to the near culling boundary for this camera relative to its local Z axis. Lower values allow the camera to see objects more up close to its origin, at the cost of lower precision across the [i]entire[/i] range. Values lower than the default can lead to increased Z-fighting.
		</member>
		<member name="projection" type="int" setter="set_projection" getter="get_projection" enum="Camera3D.ProjectionType" default="0">
			The camera's projection mode. In [constant PROJECTION_PERSPECTIVE] mode, objects' Z distance from the camera's local space scales their perceived size.
		</member>
		<member name="size" type="float" setter="set_size" getter="get_size" default="1.0">
			The camera's size in meters measured as the diameter of the width or height, depending on [member keep_aspect]. Only applicable in orthogonal and frustum modes.
