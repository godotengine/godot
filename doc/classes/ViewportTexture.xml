		Texture which displays the content of a [Viewport].
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Displays the content of a [Viewport] node as a dynamic [Texture2D]. This can be used to mix controls, 2D, and 3D elements in the same scene.
		To create a ViewportTexture in code, use the [method Viewport.get_texture] method on the target viewport.
		[b]Note:[/b] When local to scene, this texture uses [method Resource.setup_local_to_scene] to set the proxy texture and flags in the local viewport. Local to scene viewport textures will return incorrect data until the scene root is ready (see [signal Node.ready]).

			The path to the [Viewport] node to display. This is relative to the scene root, not to the node which uses the texture.
			[b]Note:[/b] In the editor, it is automatically updated when the target viewport's node path changes due to renaming or moving the viewport or its ancestors. At runtime, it may not be able to automatically update due to the inability to determine the scene root.
