	<brief_description>
		A texture that shows a curve.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Renders a given [Curve] provided to it. Simplifies the task of drawing curves and/or saving them as image files.
		If you need to store up to 3 curves within a single texture, use [CurveXYZTexture] instead. See also [GradientTexture1D] and [GradientTexture2D].

		<member name="curve" type="Curve" setter="set_curve" getter="get_curve">
			The [Curve] that is rendered onto the texture.
		</member>
		<member name="texture_mode" type="int" setter="set_texture_mode" getter="get_texture_mode" enum="CurveTexture.TextureMode" default="0">
			The format the texture should be generated with. When passing a CurveTexture as a input to a [Shader], this may need to be adjusted.
		</member>
		<member name="width" type="int" setter="set_width" getter="get_width" default="256">
			The width of the texture (in pixels). Higher values make it possible to represent high-frequency data better (such as sudden direction changes), at the cost of increased generation time and memory usage.
		</member>
	</members>
	<constants>
		<constant name="TEXTURE_MODE_RGB" value="0" enum="TextureMode">
			Store the curve equally across the red, green and blue channels. This uses more video memory, but is more compatible with shaders that only read the green and blue values.
		</constant>
		<constant name="TEXTURE_MODE_RED" value="1" enum="TextureMode">
			Store the curve only in the red channel. This saves video memory, but some custom shaders may not be able to work with this.
		</constant>
