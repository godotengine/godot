	<description>
		3D obstacle used in navigation for collision avoidance. The obstacle needs navigation data to work correctly. This can be done by having the obstacle as a child of a [Navigation] node, or using [method set_navigation]. [NavigationObstacle] is physics safe.
		Obstacles [b]don't[/b] change the resulting path from the pathfinding, they only affect the navigation agent movement in a radius. Therefore, using obstacles for the static walls in your level won't work because those walls don't exist in the pathfinding. The navigation agent will be pushed in a semi-random direction away while moving inside that radius. Obstacles are intended as a last resort option for constantly moving objects that cannot be (re)baked to a navigation mesh efficiently.

		<method name="get_navigation" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Node" />
			<description>
				Returns the [Navigation] node that the obstacle is using for its navigation system.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_rid" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="RID" />
			<description>
				Returns the [RID] of this obstacle on the [NavigationServer].
			</description>

		<method name="set_navigation">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="navigation" type="Node" />
			<description>
				Sets the [Navigation] node used by the obstacle. Useful when you don't want to make the obstacle a child of a [Navigation] node.
