	<brief_description>
		A native library for GDExtension.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The [GDExtension] resource type represents a [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_library]shared library[/url] which can expand the functionality of the engine. The [GDExtensionManager] singleton is responsible for loading, reloading, and unloading [GDExtension] resources.
		[b]Note:[/b] GDExtension itself is not a scripting language and has no relation to [GDScript] resources.
