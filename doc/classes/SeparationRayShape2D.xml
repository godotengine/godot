	<description>
		A 2D ray shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide a shape for a [CollisionShape2D]. When a [SeparationRayShape2D] collides with an object, it tries to separate itself from it by moving its endpoint to the collision point. For example, a [SeparationRayShape2D] next to a character can allow it to instantly move up when touching stairs.

			If [code]false[/code] (default), the shape always separates and returns a normal along its own direction.
			If [code]true[/code], the shape can return the correct normal and separate in any direction, allowing sliding motion on slopes.
