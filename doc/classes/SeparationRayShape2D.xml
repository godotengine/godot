	<brief_description>
		A 2D ray shape used for physics collision that tries to separate itself from any collider.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A 2D ray shape, intended for use in physics. Usually used to provide a shape for a [CollisionShape2D]. When a [SeparationRayShape2D] collides with an object, it tries to separate itself from it by moving its endpoint to the collision point. For example, a [SeparationRayShape2D] next to a character can allow it to instantly move up when touching stairs. [SeparationRayShape2D] is intended mainly for depenetation and thus will not prevent motion unless [member slide_on_slope] or [member PhysicsTestMotionParameters2D.collide_separation_ray] is [code]true[/code].

			If [code]false[/code] (default), the shape only resolves collisions by moving along the direction of the ray. Normals are only reported along the ray. The shape will only be used for depenetation.
			If [code]true[/code], the shape resolves collisions in any direction based on the correct collision normal. The shape will be able to stop motion like a regular shape.
