	<brief_description>
		Provides methods for file reading and writing operations.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This class can be used to permanently store data in the user device's file system and to read from it. This is useful for storing game save data or player configuration files.
		[b]Example:[/b] How to write and read from a file. The file named [code]"save_game.dat"[/code] will be stored in the user data folder, as specified in the [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/io/data_paths.html]Data paths[/url] documentation:
		[codeblocks]
		[gdscript]
		func save_to_file(content):
			var file = FileAccess.open("user://save_game.dat", FileAccess.WRITE)
			file.store_string(content)

		func load_from_file():
			var file = FileAccess.open("user://save_game.dat", FileAccess.READ)
			var content = file.get_as_text()
			return content
		[/gdscript]
		[csharp]
		public void SaveToFile(string content)
		{
			using var file = FileAccess.Open("user://save_game.dat", FileAccess.ModeFlags.Write);
			file.StoreString(content);
		}

		public string LoadFromFile()
		{
			using var file = FileAccess.Open("user://save_game.dat", FileAccess.ModeFlags.Read);
			string content = file.GetAsText();
			return content;
		}
		[/csharp]
		[/codeblocks]
		A [FileAccess] instance has its own file cursor, which is the position in bytes in the file where the next read/write operation will occur. Functions such as [method get_8], [method get_16], [method store_8], and [method store_16] will move the file cursor forward by the number of bytes read/written. The file cursor can be moved to a specific position using [method seek] or [method seek_end], and its position can be retrieved using [method get_position].
		A [FileAccess] instance will close its file when the instance is freed. Since it inherits [RefCounted], this happens automatically when it is no longer in use. [method close] can be called to close it earlier. In C#, the reference must be disposed manually, which can be done with the [code]using[/code] statement or by calling the [code]Dispose[/code] method directly.
		[b]Note:[/b] To access project resources once exported, it is recommended to use [ResourceLoader] instead of [FileAccess], as some files are converted to engine-specific formats and their original source files might not be present in the exported PCK package. If using [FileAccess], make sure the file is included in the export by changing its import mode to [b]Keep File (exported as is)[/b] in the Import dock, or, for files where this option is not available, change the non-resource export filter in the Export dialog to include the file's extension (e.g. [code]*.txt[/code]).
		[b]Note:[/b] Files are automatically closed only if the process exits "normally" (such as by clicking the window manager's close button or pressing [kbd]Alt + F4[/kbd]). If you stop the project execution by pressing [kbd]F8[/kbd] while the project is running, the file won't be closed as the game process will be killed. You can work around this by calling [method flush] at regular intervals.

	<methods>
		<method name="close">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Closes the currently opened file and prevents subsequent read/write operations. Use [method flush] to persist the data to disk without closing the file.
				[b]Note:[/b] [FileAccess] will automatically close when it's freed, which happens when it goes out of scope or when it gets assigned with [code]null[/code]. In C# the reference must be disposed after we are done using it, this can be done with the [code]using[/code] statement or calling the [code]Dispose[/code] method directly.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="create_temp" qualifiers="static">
			<return type="FileAccess" />
			<param index="0" name="mode_flags" type="int" enum="FileAccess.ModeFlags" />
			<param index="1" name="prefix" type="String" default="&quot;&quot;" />
			<param index="2" name="extension" type="String" default="&quot;&quot;" />
			<param index="3" name="keep" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Creates a temporary file. This file will be freed when the returned [FileAccess] is freed.
				If [param prefix] is not empty, it will be prefixed to the file name, separated by a [code]-[/code].
				If [param extension] is not empty, it will be appended to the temporary file name.
				If [param keep] is [code]true[/code], the file is not deleted when the returned [FileAccess] is freed.
				Returns [code]null[/code] if opening the file failed. You can use [method get_open_error] to check the error that occurred.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="eof_reached" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the file cursor has already read past the end of the file.
				[b]Note:[/b] [code]eof_reached() == false[/code] cannot be used to check whether there is more data available. To loop while there is more data available, use:
				[codeblocks]
				[gdscript]
				while file.get_position() &lt; file.get_length():
					# Read data
				[/gdscript]
				[csharp]
				while (file.GetPosition() &lt; file.GetLength())
				{
					// Read data
				}
				[/csharp]
				[/codeblocks]
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="file_exists" qualifiers="static">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the file exists in the given path.
				[b]Note:[/b] Many resources types are imported (e.g. textures or sound files), and their source asset will not be included in the exported game, as only the imported version is used. See [method ResourceLoader.exists] for an alternative approach that takes resource remapping into account.
				For a non-static, relative equivalent, use [method DirAccess.file_exists].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="flush">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Writes the file's buffer to disk. Flushing is automatically performed when the file is closed. This means you don't need to call [method flush] manually before closing a file. Still, calling [method flush] can be used to ensure the data is safe even if the project crashes instead of being closed gracefully.
				[b]Note:[/b] Only call [method flush] when you actually need it. Otherwise, it will decrease performance due to constant disk writes.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_8" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns the next 8 bits from the file as an integer. This advances the file cursor by 1 byte. See [method store_8] for details on what values can be stored and retrieved this way.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_16" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns the next 16 bits from the file as an integer. This advances the file cursor by 2 bytes. See [method store_16] for details on what values can be stored and retrieved this way.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_32" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns the next 32 bits from the file as an integer. This advances the file cursor by 4 bytes. See [method store_32] for details on what values can be stored and retrieved this way.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_64" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns the next 64 bits from the file as an integer. This advances the file cursor by 8 bytes. See [method store_64] for details on what values can be stored and retrieved this way.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_access_time" qualifiers="static">
			<return type="int" />
			<param index="0" name="file" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the last time the [param file] was accessed in Unix timestamp format, or [code]0[/code] on error. This Unix timestamp can be converted to another format using the [Time] singleton.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_as_text" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the whole file as a [String]. Text is interpreted as being UTF-8 encoded. This ignores the file cursor and does not affect it.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_buffer" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="PackedByteArray" />
			<param index="0" name="length" type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns next [param length] bytes of the file as a [PackedByteArray]. This advances the file cursor by [param length] bytes.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_csv_line" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="PackedStringArray" />
			<param index="0" name="delim" type="String" default="&quot;,&quot;" />
			<description>
				Returns the next value of the file in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format. You can pass a different delimiter [param delim] to use other than the default [code]","[/code] (comma). This delimiter must be one-character long, and cannot be a double quotation mark.
				Text is interpreted as being UTF-8 encoded. Text values must be enclosed in double quotes if they include the delimiter character. Double quotes within a text value can be escaped by doubling their occurrence. This advances the file cursor to after the newline character at the end of the line.
				For example, the following CSV lines are valid and will be properly parsed as two strings each:
				[codeblock lang=text]
				Alice,"Hello, Bob!"
				Bob,Alice! What a surprise!
				Alice,"I thought you'd reply with ""Hello, world""."
				[/codeblock]
				Note how the second line can omit the enclosing quotes as it does not include the delimiter. However it [i]could[/i] very well use quotes, it was only written without for demonstration purposes. The third line must use [code]""[/code] for each quotation mark that needs to be interpreted as such instead of the end of a text value.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_double" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="float" />
			<description>
				Returns the next 64 bits from the file as a floating-point number. This advances the file cursor by 8 bytes.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_error" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" enum="Error" />
			<description>
				Returns the last error that happened when trying to perform operations. Compare with the [code]ERR_FILE_*[/code] constants from [enum Error].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_extended_attribute" qualifiers="static">
			<return type="PackedByteArray" />
			<param index="0" name="file" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="attribute_name" type="String" />
			<description>
				Reads the file extended attribute with name [param attribute_name] as a byte array.
				[b]Note:[/b] This method is implemented on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
				[b]Note:[/b] Extended attributes support depends on the file system. Attributes will be lost when the file is moved between incompatible file systems.
				[b]Note:[/b] On Linux, only "user" namespace attributes are accessible, namespace prefix should not be included.
				[b]Note:[/b] On Windows, alternate data streams are used to store extended attributes.

		<method name="store_8">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="value" type="int" />
			<description>
				Stores an integer as 8 bits in the file. This advances the file cursor by 1 byte. Returns [code]true[/code] if the operation is successful.
				[b]Note:[/b] The [param value] should lie in the interval [code][0, 255][/code]. Any other value will overflow and wrap around.
				[b]Note:[/b] If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator is indeterminate.
				To store a signed integer, use [method store_64], or convert it manually (see [method store_16] for an example).

		<method name="store_16">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="value" type="int" />
			<description>
				Stores an integer as 16 bits in the file. This advances the file cursor by 2 bytes. Returns [code]true[/code] if the operation is successful.
				[b]Note:[/b] The [param value] should lie in the interval [code][0, 2^16 - 1][/code]. Any other value will overflow and wrap around.
				[b]Note:[/b] If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator is indeterminate.
				To store a signed integer, use [method store_64] or store a signed integer from the interval [code][-2^15, 2^15 - 1][/code] (i.e. keeping one bit for the signedness) and compute its sign manually when reading. For example:
				[codeblocks]
				[gdscript]
				const MAX_15B = 1 &lt;&lt; 15
				const MAX_16B = 1 &lt;&lt; 16

				func unsigned16_to_signed(unsigned):
					return (unsigned + MAX_15B) % MAX_16B - MAX_15B

				func _ready():
					var f = FileAccess.open("user://file.dat", FileAccess.WRITE_READ)
					f.store_16(-42) # This wraps around and stores 65494 (2^16 - 42).
					f.store_16(121) # In bounds, will store 121.
					f.seek(0) # Go back to start to read the stored value.
					var read1 = f.get_16() # 65494
					var read2 = f.get_16() # 121
					var converted1 = unsigned16_to_signed(read1) # -42
					var converted2 = unsigned16_to_signed(read2) # 121
				[/gdscript]
				[csharp]
				public override void _Ready()
				{
					using var f = FileAccess.Open("user://file.dat", FileAccess.ModeFlags.WriteRead);
					f.Store16(unchecked((ushort)-42)); // This wraps around and stores 65494 (2^16 - 42).
					f.Store16(121); // In bounds, will store 121.
					f.Seek(0); // Go back to start to read the stored value.
					ushort read1 = f.Get16(); // 65494
					ushort read2 = f.Get16(); // 121
					short converted1 = (short)read1; // -42
					short converted2 = (short)read2; // 121
				}

		<method name="store_csv_line">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="values" type="PackedStringArray" />
			<param index="1" name="delim" type="String" default="&quot;,&quot;" />
			<description>
				Stores the given [PackedStringArray] in the file as a line formatted in the CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format. You can pass a different delimiter [param delim] to use other than the default [code]","[/code] (comma). This delimiter must be one-character long.
				Text will be encoded as UTF-8. Returns [code]true[/code] if the operation is successful.
				[b]Note:[/b] If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator is indeterminate.

		<method name="store_double">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="value" type="float" />
			<description>
				Stores a floating-point number as 64 bits in the file. This advances the file cursor by 8 bytes. Returns [code]true[/code] if the operation is successful.
				[b]Note:[/b] If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator is indeterminate.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="store_float">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="value" type="float" />
			<description>
				Stores a floating-point number as 32 bits in the file. This advances the file cursor by 4 bytes. Returns [code]true[/code] if the operation is successful.
				[b]Note:[/b] If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator is indeterminate.

		<method name="store_half">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="value" type="float" />
			<description>
				Stores a half-precision floating-point number as 16 bits in the file. This advances the file cursor by 2 bytes. Returns [code]true[/code] if the operation is successful.
				[b]Note:[/b] If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator is indeterminate.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="store_line">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="line" type="String" />
			<description>
				Stores [param line] in the file followed by a newline character ([code]\n[/code]), encoding the text as UTF-8. This advances the file cursor by the length of the line, after the newline character. The amount of bytes written depends on the UTF-8 encoded bytes, which may be different from [method String.length] which counts the number of UTF-32 codepoints. Returns [code]true[/code] if the operation is successful.
				[b]Note:[/b] If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator is indeterminate.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="store_pascal_string">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="string" type="String" />
			<description>
				Stores the given [String] as a line in the file in Pascal format (i.e. also store the length of the string). Text will be encoded as UTF-8. This advances the file cursor by the number of bytes written depending on the UTF-8 encoded bytes, which may be different from [method String.length] which counts the number of UTF-32 codepoints. Returns [code]true[/code] if the operation is successful.
				[b]Note:[/b] If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator is indeterminate.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="store_real">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="value" type="float" />
			<description>
				Stores a floating-point number in the file. This advances the file cursor by either 4 or 8 bytes, depending on the precision used by the current Godot build.
				If using a Godot build compiled with the [code]precision=single[/code] option (the default), this method will save a 32-bit float. Otherwise, if compiled with the [code]precision=double[/code] option, this will save a 64-bit float. Returns [code]true[/code] if the operation is successful.
				[b]Note:[/b] If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator is indeterminate.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="store_string">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="string" type="String" />
			<description>
				Stores [param string] in the file without a newline character ([code]\n[/code]), encoding the text as UTF-8. This advances the file cursor by the length of the string in UTF-8 encoded bytes, which may be different from [method String.length] which counts the number of UTF-32 codepoints. Returns [code]true[/code] if the operation is successful.
				[b]Note:[/b] This method is intended to be used to write text files. The string is stored as a UTF-8 encoded buffer without string length or terminating zero, which means that it can't be loaded back easily. If you want to store a retrievable string in a binary file, consider using [method store_pascal_string] instead. For retrieving strings from a text file, you can use [code]get_buffer(length).get_string_from_utf8()[/code] (if you know the length) or [method get_as_text].
				[b]Note:[/b] If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator is indeterminate.

		<method name="store_var">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="value" type="Variant" />
			<param index="1" name="full_objects" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Stores any Variant value in the file. If [param full_objects] is [code]true[/code], encoding objects is allowed (and can potentially include code). This advances the file cursor by the number of bytes written. Returns [code]true[/code] if the operation is successful.
				Internally, this uses the same encoding mechanism as the [method @GlobalScope.var_to_bytes] method, as described in the [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/io/binary_serialization_api.html]Binary serialization API[/url] documentation.
				[b]Note:[/b] Not all properties are included. Only properties that are configured with the [constant PROPERTY_USAGE_STORAGE] flag set will be serialized. You can add a new usage flag to a property by overriding the [method Object._get_property_list] method in your class. You can also check how property usage is configured by calling [method Object._get_property_list]. See [enum PropertyUsageFlags] for the possible usage flags.
				[b]Note:[/b] If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator is indeterminate.
