	<brief_description>
		A region of 3D space that detects other [CollisionObject3D]s entering or exiting it.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[Area3D] is a region of 3D space defined by one or multiple [CollisionShape3D] or [CollisionPolygon3D] child nodes. It detects when other [CollisionObject3D]s enter or exit it, and it also keeps track of which collision objects haven't exited it yet (i.e. which one are overlapping it).
		This node can also locally alter or override physics parameters (gravity, damping) and route audio to custom audio buses.
		[b]Note:[/b] Areas and bodies created with [PhysicsServer3D] might not interact as expected with [Area3D]s, and might not emit signals or track objects correctly.
		[b]Warning:[/b] Using a [ConcavePolygonShape3D] inside a [CollisionShape3D] child of this node (created e.g. by using the [b]Create Trimesh Collision Sibling[/b] option in the [b]Mesh[/b] menu that appears when selecting a [MeshInstance3D] node) may give unexpected results, since this collision shape is hollow. If this is not desired, it has to be split into multiple [ConvexPolygonShape3D]s or primitive shapes like [BoxShape3D], or in some cases it may be replaceable by a [CollisionPolygon3D].

		<method name="get_overlapping_areas" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Area3D[]" />
			<description>
				Returns a list of intersecting [Area3D]s. The overlapping area's [member CollisionObject3D.collision_layer] must be part of this area's [member CollisionObject3D.collision_mask] in order to be detected.
				For performance reasons (collisions are all processed at the same time) this list is modified once during the physics step, not immediately after objects are moved. Consider using signals instead.

			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if the given [Area3D] intersects or overlaps this [Area3D], [code]false[/code] otherwise.
				[b]Note:[/b] The result of this test is not immediate after moving objects. For performance, list of overlaps is updated once per frame and before the physics step. Consider using signals instead.

				The [param body] argument can either be a [PhysicsBody3D] or a [GridMap] instance. While GridMaps are not physics body themselves, they register their tiles with collision shapes as a virtual physics body.

For example, on a planet 100 meters in radius with a surface gravity of 4.0 m/s², set the [member gravity] to 4.0 and the unit distance to 100.0. The gravity will have falloff according to the inverse square law, so in the example, at 200 meters from the center the gravity will be 1.0 m/s² (twice the distance, 1/4th the gravity), at 50 meters it will be 16.0 m/s² (half the distance, 4x the gravity), and so on.
