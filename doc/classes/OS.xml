		Provides access to common operating system functionalities.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The [OS] class wraps the most common functionalities for communicating with the host operating system, such as the video driver, delays, environment variables, execution of binaries, command line, etc.
		[b]Note:[/b] In Godot 4, [OS] functions related to window management, clipboard, and TTS were moved to the [DisplayServer] singleton (and the [Window] class). Functions related to time were removed and are only available in the [Time] class.

		<method name="create_instance">
			<return type="int" />
			<param index="0" name="arguments" type="PackedStringArray" />
			<description>
				Creates a new instance of Godot that runs independently. The [param arguments] are used in the given order and separated by a space.
				If the process is successfully created, this method returns the new process' ID, which you can use to monitor the process (and potentially terminate it with [method kill]). If the process cannot be created, this method returns [code]-1[/code].
				See [method create_process] if you wish to run a different process.
				[b]Note:[/b] This method is implemented on Android, Linux, macOS and Windows.

		<method name="create_process">
			<return type="int" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="arguments" type="PackedStringArray" />
			<param index="2" name="open_console" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Creates a new process that runs independently of Godot. It will not terminate when Godot terminates. The path specified in [param path] must exist and be an executable file or macOS [code].app[/code] bundle. The path is resolved based on the current platform. The [param arguments] are used in the given order and separated by a space.
				On Windows, if [param open_console] is [code]true[/code] and the process is a console app, a new terminal window will be opened.
				If the process is successfully created, this method returns its process ID, which you can use to monitor the process (and potentially terminate it with [method kill]). Otherwise, this method returns [code]-1[/code].
				[b]Example:[/b] Run another instance of the project:
				[codeblocks]
				[gdscript]
				var pid = OS.create_process(OS.get_executable_path(), [])
				[/gdscript]
				[csharp]
				var pid = OS.CreateProcess(OS.GetExecutablePath(), []);
				[/csharp]
				[/codeblocks]
				See [method execute] if you wish to run an external command and retrieve the results.
				[b]Note:[/b] This method is implemented on Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows.
				[b]Note:[/b] On macOS, sandboxed applications are limited to run only embedded helper executables, specified during export or system .app bundle, system .app bundles will ignore arguments.

		<method name="delay_msec" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="msec" type="int" />
			<description>
				Delays execution of the current thread by [param msec] milliseconds. [param msec] must be greater than or equal to [code]0[/code]. Otherwise, [method delay_msec] does nothing and prints an error message.
				[b]Note:[/b] [method delay_msec] is a [i]blocking[/i] way to delay code execution. To delay code execution in a non-blocking way, you may use [method SceneTree.create_timer]. Awaiting with [SceneTreeTimer] delays the execution of code placed below the [code]await[/code] without affecting the rest of the project (or editor, for [EditorPlugin]s and [EditorScript]s).
				[b]Note:[/b] When [method delay_msec] is called on the main thread, it will freeze the project and will prevent it from redrawing and registering input until the delay has passed. When using [method delay_msec] as part of an [EditorPlugin] or [EditorScript], it will freeze the editor but won't freeze the project if it is currently running (since the project is an independent child process).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="delay_usec" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="usec" type="int" />
			<description>
				Delays execution of the current thread by [param usec] microseconds. [param usec] must be greater than or equal to [code]0[/code]. Otherwise, [method delay_usec] does nothing and prints an error message.
				[b]Note:[/b] [method delay_usec] is a [i]blocking[/i] way to delay code execution. To delay code execution in a non-blocking way, you may use [method SceneTree.create_timer]. Awaiting with a [SceneTreeTimer] delays the execution of code placed below the [code]await[/code] without affecting the rest of the project (or editor, for [EditorPlugin]s and [EditorScript]s).
				[b]Note:[/b] When [method delay_usec] is called on the main thread, it will freeze the project and will prevent it from redrawing and registering input until the delay has passed.

		<method name="execute">
			<return type="int" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="arguments" type="PackedStringArray" />
			<param index="2" name="output" type="Array" default="[]" />
			<param index="3" name="read_stderr" type="bool" default="false" />
			<param index="4" name="open_console" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Executes the given process in a [i]blocking[/i] way. The file specified in [param path] must exist and be executable. The system path resolution will be used. The [param arguments] are used in the given order, separated by spaces, and wrapped in quotes.
				If an [param output] array is provided, the complete shell output of the process is appended to [param output] as a single [String] element. If [param read_stderr] is [code]true[/code], the output to the standard error stream is also appended to the array.
				On Windows, if [param open_console] is [code]true[/code] and the process is a console app, a new terminal window is opened.
				This method returns the exit code of the command, or [code]-1[/code] if the process fails to execute.
				[b]Note:[/b] The main thread will be blocked until the executed command terminates. Use [Thread] to create a separate thread that will not block the main thread, or use [method create_process] to create a completely independent process.
				For example, to retrieve a list of the working directory's contents:
				[codeblocks]
				[gdscript]
				var output = []
				var exit_code = OS.execute("ls", ["-l", "/tmp"], output)
				[/gdscript]
				[csharp]
				Godot.Collections.Array output = [];
				int exitCode = OS.Execute("ls", ["-l", "/tmp"], output);
				[/csharp]
				[/codeblocks]
				If you wish to access a shell built-in or execute a composite command, a platform-specific shell can be invoked. For example:
				[codeblocks]
				[gdscript]
				var output = []
				OS.execute("CMD.exe", ["/C", "cd %TEMP% &amp;&amp; dir"], output)
				[/gdscript]
				[csharp]
				Godot.Collections.Array output = [];
				OS.Execute("CMD.exe", ["/C", "cd %TEMP% &amp;&amp; dir"], output);
				[/csharp]
				[/codeblocks]
				[b]Note:[/b] This method is implemented on Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows.
				[b]Note:[/b] To execute a Windows command interpreter built-in command, specify [code]cmd.exe[/code] in [param path], [code]/c[/code] as the first argument, and the desired command as the second argument.
				[b]Note:[/b] To execute a PowerShell built-in command, specify [code]powershell.exe[/code] in [param path], [code]-Command[/code] as the first argument, and the desired command as the second argument.
				[b]Note:[/b] To execute a Unix shell built-in command, specify shell executable name in [param path], [code]-c[/code] as the first argument, and the desired command as the second argument.
				[b]Note:[/b] On macOS, sandboxed applications are limited to run only embedded helper executables, specified during export.
				[b]Note:[/b] On Android, system commands such as [code]dumpsys[/code] can only be run on a rooted device.

		<method name="execute_with_pipe">
			<return type="Dictionary" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="arguments" type="PackedStringArray" />
			<param index="2" name="blocking" type="bool" default="true" />
			<description>
				Creates a new process that runs independently of Godot with redirected IO. It will not terminate when Godot terminates. The path specified in [param path] must exist and be an executable file or macOS [code].app[/code] bundle. The path is resolved based on the current platform. The [param arguments] are used in the given order and separated by a space.
				If [param blocking] is [code]false[/code], created pipes work in non-blocking mode, i.e. read and write operations will return immediately. Use [method FileAccess.get_error] to check if the last read/write operation was successful.
				If the process cannot be created, this method returns an empty [Dictionary]. Otherwise, this method returns a [Dictionary] with the following keys:
				- [code]"stdio"[/code] - [FileAccess] to access the process stdin and stdout pipes (read/write).
				- [code]"stderr"[/code] - [FileAccess] to access the process stderr pipe (read only).
				- [code]"pid"[/code] - Process ID as an [int], which you can use to monitor the process (and potentially terminate it with [method kill]).
				[b]Note:[/b] This method is implemented on Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows.
				[b]Note:[/b] To execute a Windows command interpreter built-in command, specify [code]cmd.exe[/code] in [param path], [code]/c[/code] as the first argument, and the desired command as the second argument.
				[b]Note:[/b] To execute a PowerShell built-in command, specify [code]powershell.exe[/code] in [param path], [code]-Command[/code] as the first argument, and the desired command as the second argument.
				[b]Note:[/b] To execute a Unix shell built-in command, specify shell executable name in [param path], [code]-c[/code] as the first argument, and the desired command as the second argument.
				[b]Note:[/b] On macOS, sandboxed applications are limited to run only embedded helper executables, specified during export or system .app bundle, system .app bundles will ignore arguments.

		<method name="find_keycode_from_string" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" enum="Key" />
			<param index="0" name="string" type="String" />
			<description>
				Finds the keycode for the given string. The returned values are equivalent to the [enum Key] constants.
				[codeblocks]
				[gdscript]
				print(OS.find_keycode_from_string("C"))         # Prints 67 (KEY_C)
				print(OS.find_keycode_from_string("Escape"))    # Prints 4194305 (KEY_ESCAPE)
				print(OS.find_keycode_from_string("Shift+Tab")) # Prints 37748738 (KEY_MASK_SHIFT | KEY_TAB)
				print(OS.find_keycode_from_string("Unknown"))   # Prints 0 (KEY_NONE)
				[/gdscript]
				[csharp]
				GD.Print(OS.FindKeycodeFromString("C"));         // Prints C (Key.C)
				GD.Print(OS.FindKeycodeFromString("Escape"));    // Prints Escape (Key.Escape)
				GD.Print(OS.FindKeycodeFromString("Shift+Tab")); // Prints 37748738 (KeyModifierMask.MaskShift | Key.Tab)
				GD.Print(OS.FindKeycodeFromString("Unknown"));   // Prints None (Key.None)
				[/csharp]
				[/codeblocks]
				See also [method get_keycode_string].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_cache_dir" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the [i]global[/i] cache data directory according to the operating system's standards.
				On the Linux/BSD platform, this path can be overridden by setting the [code]XDG_CACHE_HOME[/code] environment variable before starting the project. See [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/io/data_paths.html]File paths in Godot projects[/url] in the documentation for more information. See also [method get_config_dir] and [method get_data_dir].
				Not to be confused with [method get_user_data_dir], which returns the [i]project-specific[/i] user data path.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_cmdline_args">
			<return type="PackedStringArray" />
			<description>
				Returns the command-line arguments passed to the engine, excluding arguments processed by the engine, such as [code]--headless[/code] and [code]--fullscreen[/code].
				[codeblock]
				# Godot has been executed with the following command:
				# godot --headless --verbose --scene my_scene.tscn --custom
				OS.get_cmdline_args() # Returns ["--scene", "my_scene.tscn", "--custom"]
				[/codeblock]
				Command-line arguments can be written in any form, including both [code]--key value[/code] and [code]--key=value[/code] forms so they can be properly parsed, as long as custom command-line arguments do not conflict with engine arguments.
				You can also incorporate environment variables using the [method get_environment] method.
				You can set [member ProjectSettings.editor/run/main_run_args] to define command-line arguments to be passed by the editor when running the project.
				[b]Example:[/b] Parse command-line arguments into a [Dictionary] using the [code]--key=value[/code] form for arguments:
				[codeblocks]
				[gdscript]
				var arguments = {}
				for argument in OS.get_cmdline_args():
					if argument.contains("="):
						var key_value = argument.split("=")
						arguments[key_value[0].trim_prefix("--")] = key_value[1]
					else:
						# Options without an argument will be present in the dictionary,
						# with the value set to an empty string.
						arguments[argument.trim_prefix("--")] = ""
				[/gdscript]
				[csharp]
				var arguments = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;();
				foreach (var argument in OS.GetCmdlineArgs())
				{
					if (argument.Contains('='))
					{
						string[] keyValue = argument.Split("=");
						arguments[keyValue[0].TrimPrefix("--")] = keyValue[1];
					}
					else
					{
						// Options without an argument will be present in the dictionary,
						// with the value set to an empty string.
						arguments[argument.TrimPrefix("--")] = "";
					}
				}
				[/csharp]
				[/codeblocks]
				[b]Note:[/b] Passing custom user arguments directly is not recommended, as the engine may discard or modify them. Instead, pass the standard UNIX double dash ([code]--[/code]) and then the custom arguments, which the engine will ignore by design. These can be read via [method get_cmdline_user_args].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_cmdline_user_args">
			<return type="PackedStringArray" />
			<description>
				Returns the command-line user arguments passed to the engine. User arguments are ignored by the engine and reserved for the user. They are passed after the double dash [code]--[/code] argument. [code]++[/code] may be used when [code]--[/code] is intercepted by another program (such as [code]startx[/code]).
				[codeblock]
				# Godot has been executed with the following command:
				# godot --fullscreen --custom -- --level=2 --hardcore

				OS.get_cmdline_args()      # Returns ["--custom"]
				OS.get_cmdline_user_args() # Returns ["--level=2", "--hardcore"]
				[/codeblock]
				To get arguments passed before [code]--[/code] or [code]++[/code], use [method get_cmdline_args].

		<method name="get_config_dir" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the [i]global[/i] user configuration directory according to the operating system's standards.
				On the Linux/BSD platform, this path can be overridden by setting the [code]XDG_CONFIG_HOME[/code] environment variable before starting the project. See [url=$DOCS_URL/tutorials/io/data_paths.html]File paths in Godot projects[/url] in the documentation for more information. See also [method get_cache_dir] and [method get_data_dir].
				Not to be confused with [method get_user_data_dir], which returns the [i]project-specific[/i] user data path.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_connected_midi_inputs">
			<return type="PackedStringArray" />
			<description>
				Returns an array of connected MIDI device names, if they exist. Returns an empty array if the system MIDI driver has not previously been initialized with [method open_midi_inputs]. See also [method close_midi_inputs].
				[b]Note:[/b] This method is implemented on Linux, macOS, Windows, and Web.
				[b]Note:[/b] On the Web platform, Web MIDI needs to be supported by the browser. [url=https://caniuse.com/midi]For the time being[/url], it is currently supported by all major browsers, except Safari.
				[b]Note:[/b] On the Web platform, using MIDI input requires a browser permission to be granted first. This permission request is performed when calling [method open_midi_inputs]. The browser will refrain from processing MIDI input until the user accepts the permission request.

		<method name="get_entropy">
			<return type="PackedByteArray" />
			<param index="0" name="size" type="int" />
			<description>
				Generates a [PackedByteArray] of cryptographically secure random bytes with given [param size].
				[b]Note:[/b] Generating large quantities of bytes using this method can result in locking and entropy of lower quality on most platforms. Using [method Crypto.generate_random_bytes] is preferred in most cases.

		<method name="get_locale" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the host OS locale as a [String] of the form [code]language_Script_COUNTRY_VARIANT@extra[/code]. Every substring after [code]language[/code] is optional and may not exist.
				- [code]language[/code] - 2 or 3-letter [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes]language code[/url], in lower case.
				- [code skip-lint]Script[/code] - 4-letter [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15924]script code[/url], in title case.

				- [code]VARIANT[/code] - language variant, region and sort order. The variant can have any number of underscored keywords.
				- [code]extra[/code] - semicolon separated list of additional key words. This may include currency, calendar, sort order and numbering system information.
				If you want only the language code and not the fully specified locale from the OS, you can use [method get_locale_language].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_locale_language" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the host OS locale's 2 or 3-letter [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes]language code[/url] as a string which should be consistent on all platforms. This is equivalent to extracting the [code]language[/code] part of the [method get_locale] string.
				This can be used to narrow down fully specified locale strings to only the "common" language code, when you don't need the additional information about country code or variants. For example, for a French Canadian user with [code]fr_CA[/code] locale, this would return [code]fr[/code].

		<method name="get_memory_info" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="Dictionary" />
			<description>
				Returns a [Dictionary] containing information about the current memory with the following entries:
				- [code]"physical"[/code] - total amount of usable physical memory in bytes. This value can be slightly less than the actual physical memory amount, since it does not include memory reserved by the kernel and devices.
				- [code]"free"[/code] - amount of physical memory, that can be immediately allocated without disk access or other costly operations, in bytes. The process might be able to allocate more physical memory, but this action will require moving inactive pages to disk, which can be expensive.
				- [code]"available"[/code] - amount of memory that can be allocated without extending the swap file(s), in bytes. This value includes both physical memory and swap.
				- [code]"stack"[/code] - size of the current thread stack in bytes.
				[b]Note:[/b] Each entry's value may be [code]-1[/code] if it is unknown.

			<description>
				Reads a user input as raw data from the standard input. This operation can be [i]blocking[/i], which causes the window to freeze if [method read_buffer_from_stdin] is called on the main thread.
				- If standard input is console, this method will block until the program receives a line break in standard input (usually by the user pressing [kbd]Enter[/kbd]).
				- If standard input is pipe, this method will block until a specific amount of data is read or pipe is closed.
				- If standard input is a file, this method will read a specific amount of data (or less if end-of-file is reached) and return immediately.
				[b]Note:[/b] This method is implemented on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
				[b]Note:[/b] On exported Windows builds, run the console wrapper executable to access the terminal. If standard input is console, calling this method without console wrapped will freeze permanently. If standard input is pipe or file, it can be used without console wrapper. If you need a single executable with full console support, use a custom build compiled with the [code]windows_subsystem=console[/code] flag.

				This method can be used to apply setting changes that require a restart. See also [method is_restart_on_exit_set] and [method get_restart_on_exit_arguments].
				[b]Note:[/b] This method is only effective on desktop platforms, and only when the project isn't started from the editor. It will have no effect on mobile and Web platforms, or when the project is started from the editor.
				[b]Note:[/b] If the project process crashes or is [i]killed[/i] by the user (by sending [code]SIGKILL[/code] instead of the usual [code]SIGTERM[/code]), the project won't restart automatically.

		<method name="set_thread_name">
			<return type="int" enum="Error" />
			<param index="0" name="name" type="String" />
			<description>
				Assigns the given name to the current thread. Returns [constant ERR_UNAVAILABLE] if unavailable on the current platform.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_use_file_access_save_and_swap">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="enabled" type="bool" />
			<description>
				If [param enabled] is [code]true[/code], when opening a file for writing, a temporary file is used in its place. When closed, it is automatically applied to the target file.
				This can useful when files may be opened by other applications, such as antiviruses, text editors, or even the Godot editor itself.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="shell_open">
			<return type="int" enum="Error" />
			<param index="0" name="uri" type="String" />
			<description>
				Requests the OS to open a resource identified by [param uri] with the most appropriate program. For example:
				- [code]OS.shell_open("C:\\Users\\name\\Downloads")[/code] on Windows opens the file explorer at the user's Downloads folder.
				- [code]OS.shell_open("C:/Users/name/Downloads")[/code] also works on Windows and opens the file explorer at the user's Downloads folder.
				- [code]OS.shell_open("https://godotengine.org")[/code] opens the default web browser on the official Godot website.
				- [code]OS.shell_open("mailto:example@example.com")[/code] opens the default email client with the "To" field set to [code]example@example.com[/code]. See [url=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2368]RFC 2368 - The [code]mailto[/code] URL scheme[/url] for a list of fields that can be added.
				Use [method ProjectSettings.globalize_path] to convert a [code]res://[/code] or [code]user://[/code] project path into a system path for use with this method.
				[b]Note:[/b] Use [method String.uri_encode] to encode characters within URLs in a URL-safe, portable way. This is especially required for line breaks. Otherwise, [method shell_open] may not work correctly in a project exported to the Web platform.
				[b]Note:[/b] This method is implemented on Android, iOS, Web, Linux, macOS and Windows.

		<method name="shell_show_in_file_manager">
			<return type="int" enum="Error" />
			<param index="0" name="file_or_dir_path" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="open_folder" type="bool" default="true" />
			<description>
				Requests the OS to open the file manager, navigate to the given [param file_or_dir_path] and select the target file or folder.
				If [param open_folder] is [code]true[/code] and [param file_or_dir_path] is a valid directory path, the OS will open the file manager and navigate to the target folder without selecting anything.
				Use [method ProjectSettings.globalize_path] to convert a [code]res://[/code] or [code]user://[/code] project path into a system path to use with this method.
				[b]Note:[/b] This method is currently only implemented on Windows and macOS. On other platforms, it will fallback to [method shell_open] with a directory path of [param file_or_dir_path] prefixed with [code]file://[/code].
			</description>

		<method name="unset_environment" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="variable" type="String" />
			<description>
				Removes the given environment variable from the current environment, if it exists. The [param variable] name cannot be empty or include the [code]=[/code] character. The environment variable will be removed for the Godot process and any process executed with [method execute] after running [method unset_environment]. The removal of the environment variable will [i]not[/i] persist to processes run after the Godot process was terminated.
				[b]Note:[/b] Environment variable names are case-sensitive on all platforms except Windows.
