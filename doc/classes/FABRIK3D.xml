	<description>
		[FABRIK3D] is position based IK, allowing precise and accurate tracking of targets. It's ideal for simple chains without limitations.
		The result twist around forward vector will always be [code]0[/code].
		[b]Note:[/b] When the target is close to the root, it tends to produce zig-zag patterns, resulting in unnatural visual movement.
