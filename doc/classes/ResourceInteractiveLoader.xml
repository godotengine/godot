		<method name="get_stage_count" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="int" />
			<description>
				Returns the total amount of stages (calls to [method poll]) needed to completely load this resource.
			</description>

		<method name="poll">
			<return type="int" enum="Error" />
			<description>
				Polls the loading operation, i.e. loads a data chunk up to the next stage.
				Returns [constant OK] if the poll is successful but the load operation has not finished yet (intermediate stage). This means [method poll] will have to be called again until the last stage is completed.
				Returns [constant ERR_FILE_EOF] if the load operation has completed successfully. The loaded resource can be obtained by calling [method get_resource].
				Returns another [enum Error] code if the poll has failed.

		</method>
		<method name="wait">
			<return type="int" enum="Error" />
			<description>
				Polls the loading operation successively until the resource is completely loaded or a [method poll] fails.
				Returns [constant ERR_FILE_EOF] if the load operation has completed successfully. The loaded resource can be obtained by calling [method get_resource].
				Returns another [enum Error] code if a poll has failed, aborting the operation.
