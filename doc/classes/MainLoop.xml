		Abstract base class for the game's main loop.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[MainLoop] is the abstract base class for a Godot project's game loop. It is inherited by [SceneTree], which is the default game loop implementation used in Godot projects, though it is also possible to write and use one's own [MainLoop] subclass instead of the scene tree.
		Upon the application start, a [MainLoop] implementation must be provided to the OS; otherwise, the application will exit. This happens automatically (and a [SceneTree] is created) unless a main [Script] is provided from the command line (with e.g. [code]godot -s my_loop.gd[/code], which should then be a [MainLoop] implementation.
		Here is an example script implementing a simple [MainLoop]:
		[codeblock]
		extends MainLoop

		var time_elapsed = 0
		var keys_typed = []
		var quit = false

		func _initialize():
		    print("Initialized:")
		    print("  Starting time: %s" % str(time_elapsed))

		func _idle(delta):
		    time_elapsed += delta
		    # Return true to end the main loop.
		    return quit

		func _input_event(event):
		    # Record keys.
		    if event is InputEventKey and event.pressed and !event.echo:
		        keys_typed.append(OS.get_scancode_string(event.scancode))
		        # Quit on Escape press.
		        if event.scancode == KEY_ESCAPE:
		            quit = true
		    # Quit on any mouse click.
		    if event is InputEventMouseButton:
		        quit = true

		func _finalize():
		    print("Finalized:")
		    print("  End time: %s" % str(time_elapsed))
		    print("  Keys typed: %s" % var2str(keys_typed))
		[/codeblock]

	<methods>
		<method name="_drop_files" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="files" type="PoolStringArray" />
			<argument index="1" name="from_screen" type="int" />
			<description>
				Called when files are dragged from the OS file manager and dropped in the game window. The arguments are a list of file paths and the identifier of the screen where the drag originated.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="_finalize" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Called before the program exits.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="_global_menu_action" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="id" type="Variant" />
			<argument index="1" name="meta" type="Variant" />
			<description>
				Called when the user performs an action in the system global menu (e.g. the Mac OS menu bar).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="_idle" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="bool" />
			<argument index="0" name="delta" type="float" />
			<description>
				Called each idle frame with the time since the last idle frame as argument (in seconds). Equivalent to [method Node._process].
				If implemented, the method must return a boolean value. [code]true[/code] ends the main loop, while [code]false[/code] lets it proceed to the next frame.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="_initialize" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Called once during initialization.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="_input_event" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="event" type="InputEvent" />
			<description>
				Called whenever an [InputEvent] is received by the main loop.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="_input_text" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="text" type="String" />
			<description>
				Deprecated callback, does not do anything. Use [method _input_event] to parse text input. Will be removed in Godot 4.0.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="_iteration" qualifiers="virtual">
			<return type="bool" />
			<argument index="0" name="delta" type="float" />
			<description>
				Called each physics frame with the time since the last physics frame as argument ([code]delta[/code], in seconds). Equivalent to [method Node._physics_process].
				If implemented, the method must return a boolean value. [code]true[/code] ends the main loop, while [code]false[/code] lets it proceed to the next frame.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="finish">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Should not be called manually, override [method _finalize] instead. Will be removed in Godot 4.0.

		<method name="idle">
			<return type="bool" />
			<argument index="0" name="delta" type="float" />

		<method name="input_event">
			<return type="void" />
			<argument index="0" name="event" type="InputEvent" />
