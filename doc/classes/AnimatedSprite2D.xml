	<brief_description>
		Sprite node that contains multiple textures as frames to play for animation.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[AnimatedSprite2D] is similar to the [Sprite2D] node, except it carries multiple textures as animation frames. Animations are created using a [SpriteFrames] resource, which allows you to import image files (or a folder containing said files) to provide the animation frames for the sprite. The [SpriteFrames] resource can be configured in the editor via the SpriteFrames bottom panel.

	<methods>
		<method name="get_playing_speed" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="float" />
			<description>
				Returns the actual playing speed of current animation or [code]0[/code] if not playing. This speed is the [member speed_scale] property multiplied by [code]custom_speed[/code] argument specified when calling the [method play] method.
				Returns a negative value if the current animation is playing backwards.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="is_playing" qualifiers="const">
			<return type="bool" />
			<description>
				Returns [code]true[/code] if an animation is currently playing (even if [member speed_scale] and/or [code]custom_speed[/code] are [code]0[/code]).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="pause">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Pauses the currently playing animation. The [member frame] and [member frame_progress] will be kept and calling [method play] or [method play_backwards] without arguments will resume the animation from the current playback position.
				See also [method stop].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="play">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="name" type="StringName" default="&amp;&quot;&quot;" />
			<param index="1" name="custom_speed" type="float" default="1.0" />
			<param index="2" name="from_end" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Plays the animation with key [param name]. If [param custom_speed] is negative and [param from_end] is [code]true[/code], the animation will play backwards (which is equivalent to calling [method play_backwards]).
				If this method is called with that same animation [param name], or with no [param name] parameter, the assigned animation will resume playing if it was paused.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="play_backwards">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="name" type="StringName" default="&amp;&quot;&quot;" />
			<description>
				Plays the animation with key [param name] in reverse.
				This method is a shorthand for [method play] with [code]custom_speed = -1.0[/code] and [code]from_end = true[/code], so see its description for more information.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_frame_and_progress">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="frame" type="int" />
			<param index="1" name="progress" type="float" />
			<description>
				The setter of [member frame] resets the [member frame_progress] to [code]0.0[/code] implicitly, but this method avoids that.
				This is useful when you want to carry over the current [member frame_progress] to another [member frame].
				[b]Example:[/b]
				[codeblocks]
				[gdscript]
				# Change the animation with keeping the frame index and progress.
				var current_frame = animated_sprite.get_frame()
				var current_progress = animated_sprite.get_frame_progress()
				animated_sprite.play("walk_another_skin")
				animated_sprite.set_frame_and_progress(current_frame, current_progress)
				[/gdscript]
				[/codeblocks]
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="stop">
			<return type="void" />
			<description>
				Stops the currently playing animation. The animation position is reset to [code]0[/code] and the [code]custom_speed[/code] is reset to [code]1.0[/code]. See also [method pause].
			</description>
		</method>

	<members>
		<member name="animation" type="StringName" setter="set_animation" getter="get_animation" default="&amp;&quot;default&quot;">
			The current animation from the [member sprite_frames] resource. If this value is changed, the [member frame] counter and the [member frame_progress] are reset.
		</member>
		<member name="autoplay" type="String" setter="set_autoplay" getter="get_autoplay" default="&quot;&quot;">
			The key of the animation to play when the scene loads.
		</member>
		<member name="centered" type="bool" setter="set_centered" getter="is_centered" default="true">
			If [code]true[/code], texture will be centered.
			[b]Note:[/b] For games with a pixel art aesthetic, textures may appear deformed when centered. This is caused by their position being between pixels. To prevent this, set this property to [code]false[/code], or consider enabling [member ProjectSettings.rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_vertices_to_pixel] and [member ProjectSettings.rendering/2d/snap/snap_2d_transforms_to_pixel].
		</member>
		<member name="flip_h" type="bool" setter="set_flip_h" getter="is_flipped_h" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], texture is flipped horizontally.
		</member>
		<member name="flip_v" type="bool" setter="set_flip_v" getter="is_flipped_v" default="false">
			If [code]true[/code], texture is flipped vertically.
		</member>
		<member name="frame" type="int" setter="set_frame" getter="get_frame" default="0">
			The displayed animation frame's index. Setting this property also resets [member frame_progress]. If this is not desired, use [method set_frame_and_progress].
		</member>
		<member name="frame_progress" type="float" setter="set_frame_progress" getter="get_frame_progress" default="0.0">
			The progress value between [code]0.0[/code] and [code]1.0[/code] until the current frame transitions to the next frame. If the animation is playing backwards, the value transitions from [code]1.0[/code] to [code]0.0[/code].
		</member>
		<member name="offset" type="Vector2" setter="set_offset" getter="get_offset" default="Vector2(0, 0)">
			The texture's drawing offset.
		</member>
		<member name="speed_scale" type="float" setter="set_speed_scale" getter="get_speed_scale" default="1.0">
			The speed scaling ratio. For example, if this value is [code]1[/code], then the animation plays at normal speed. If it's [code]0.5[/code], then it plays at half speed. If it's [code]2[/code], then it plays at double speed.
			If set to a negative value, the animation is played in reverse. If set to [code]0[/code], the animation will not advance.
		</member>
		<member name="sprite_frames" type="SpriteFrames" setter="set_sprite_frames" getter="get_sprite_frames">
			The [SpriteFrames] resource containing the animation(s). Allows you the option to load, edit, clear, make unique and save the states of the [SpriteFrames] resource.
