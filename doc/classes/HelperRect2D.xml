		A 2D editor helper node that helps you customize dragging behavior.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		HelperRect2D is a 2D helper node in the editor that is draggable and allows you to customize your behavior. You can customize the behavior by overriding [method _rect_updated].
		Unlike [ReferenceRect], this node is light enough to allow you to customize your own behavior.
