	<description>
		A [Container] node that holds a [Viewport], automatically setting its size.
		[b]Note:[/b] Changing a ViewportContainer's [member Control.rect_scale] will cause its contents to appear distorted. To change its visual size without causing distortion, adjust the node's margins instead (if it's not already in a container).

			Divides the viewport's effective resolution by this value while preserving its scale. This can be used to speed up rendering.
			For example, a 1280×720 viewport with [member stretch_shrink] set to [code]2[/code] will be rendered at 640×360 while occupying the same size in the container.
			[b]Note:[/b] [member stretch] must be [code]true[/code] for this property to work.
