	<description>
		A resource to add to an [AnimationNodeBlendTree]. Blends two animations out of three linearly out of three based on the amount value.
		This animation node has three inputs:
		- The base animation to blend with
		- A "-blend" animation to blend with when the blend amount is negative value
		- A "+blend" animation to blend with when the blend amount is positive value
		In general, the blend value should be in the [code][-1.0, 1.0][/code] range. Values outside of this range can blend amplified animations, however, [AnimationNodeAdd3] works better for this purpose.
