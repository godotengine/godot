	<description>
		A Spotlight is a type of [Light3D] node that emits lights in a specific direction, in the shape of a cone. The light is attenuated through the distance. This attenuation can be configured by changing the energy, radius and attenuation parameters of [Light3D].
		[b]Note:[/b] When using the Mobile or Compatibility rendering methods, spot lights will only correctly affect meshes whose visibility AABB intersects with the light's AABB. If using a shader to deform the mesh in a way that makes it go outside its AABB, [member GeometryInstance3D.extra_cull_margin] must be increased on the mesh. Otherwise, the light may not be visible on the mesh.
