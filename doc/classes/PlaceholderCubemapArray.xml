	<brief_description>
		A [CubemapArray] without image data.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		This class replaces a [CubemapArray] or a [CubemapArray]-derived class in 2 conditions:
		- In dedicated server mode, where the image data shouldn't affect game logic. This allows reducing the exported PCK's size significantly.
		- When the [CubemapArray]-derived class is missing, for example when using a different engine version.
		[b]Note:[/b] This class is not intended for rendering or for use in shaders. Operations like calculating UV are not guaranteed to work.
