	<brief_description>
		A singleton for loading resource files.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A singleton used to load resource files from the filesystem.
		It uses the many [ResourceFormatLoader] classes registered in the engine (either built-in or from a plugin) to load files into memory and convert them to a format that can be used by the engine.
		[b]Note:[/b] You have to import the files into the engine first to load them using [method load]. If you want to load [Image]s at run-time, you may use [method Image.load]. If you want to import audio files, you can use the snippet described in [member AudioStreamMP3.data].

	<methods>
		<method name="add_resource_format_loader">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="format_loader" type="ResourceFormatLoader" />
			<param index="1" name="at_front" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Registers a new [ResourceFormatLoader]. The ResourceLoader will use the ResourceFormatLoader as described in [method load].
				This method is performed implicitly for ResourceFormatLoaders written in GDScript (see [ResourceFormatLoader] for more information).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="exists">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="type_hint" type="String" default="&quot;&quot;" />
			<description>
				Returns whether a recognized resource exists for the given [param path].
				An optional [param type_hint] can be used to further specify the [Resource] type that should be handled by the [ResourceFormatLoader]. Anything that inherits from [Resource] can be used as a type hint, for example [Image].
				[b]Note:[/b] If you use [method Resource.take_over_path], this method will return [code]true[/code] for the taken path even if the resource wasn't saved (i.e. exists only in resource cache).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_cached_ref">
			<return type="Resource" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the cached resource reference for the given [param path].
				[b]Note:[/b] If the resource is not cached, the returned [Resource] will be invalid.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_dependencies">
			<return type="PackedStringArray" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the dependencies for the resource at the given [param path].
				[b]Note:[/b] The dependencies are returned with slices separated by [code]::[/code]. You can use [method String.get_slice] to get their components.
				[codeblock]
				for dep in ResourceLoader.get_dependencies(path):
				    print(dep.get_slice("::", 0)) # Prints UID.
				    print(dep.get_slice("::", 2)) # Prints path.
				[/codeblock]
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_recognized_extensions_for_type">
			<return type="PackedStringArray" />
			<param index="0" name="type" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the list of recognized extensions for a resource type.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_resource_uid">
			<return type="int" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the ID associated with a given resource path, or [code]-1[/code] when no such ID exists.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="has_cached">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns whether a cached resource is available for the given [param path].
				Once a resource has been loaded by the engine, it is cached in memory for faster access, and future calls to the [method load] method will use the cached version. The cached resource can be overridden by using [method Resource.take_over_path] on a new resource for that same path.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="list_directory">
			<return type="PackedStringArray" />
			<param index="0" name="directory_path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Lists a directory (as example: "res://assets/enemies"), returning all resources contained within. The resource files are the original file names as visible in the editor before exporting.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="load">
			<return type="Resource" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="type_hint" type="String" default="&quot;&quot;" />
			<param index="2" name="cache_mode" type="int" enum="ResourceLoader.CacheMode" default="1" />
			<description>
				Loads a resource at the given [param path], caching the result for further access.
				The registered [ResourceFormatLoader]s are queried sequentially to find the first one which can handle the file's extension, and then attempt loading. If loading fails, the remaining ResourceFormatLoaders are also attempted.
				An optional [param type_hint] can be used to further specify the [Resource] type that should be handled by the [ResourceFormatLoader]. Anything that inherits from [Resource] can be used as a type hint, for example [Image].
				The [param cache_mode] property defines whether and how the cache should be used or updated when loading the resource. See [enum CacheMode] for details.
				Returns an empty resource if no [ResourceFormatLoader] could handle the file, and prints an error if no file is found at the specified path.
				GDScript has a simplified [method @GDScript.load] built-in method which can be used in most situations, leaving the use of [ResourceLoader] for more advanced scenarios.
				[b]Note:[/b] If [member ProjectSettings.editor/export/convert_text_resources_to_binary] is [code]true[/code], [method @GDScript.load] will not be able to read converted files in an exported project. If you rely on run-time loading of files present within the PCK, set [member ProjectSettings.editor/export/convert_text_resources_to_binary] to [code]false[/code].
				[b]Note:[/b] Relative paths will be prefixed with [code]"res://"[/code] before loading, to avoid unexpected results make sure your paths are absolute.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="load_threaded_get">
			<return type="Resource" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the resource loaded by [method load_threaded_request].
				If this is called before the loading thread is done (i.e. [method load_threaded_get_status] is not [constant THREAD_LOAD_LOADED]), the calling thread will be blocked until the resource has finished loading. However, it's recommended to use [method load_threaded_get_status] to known when the load has actually completed.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="load_threaded_get_status">
			<return type="int" enum="ResourceLoader.ThreadLoadStatus" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="progress" type="Array" default="[]" />
			<description>
				Returns the status of a threaded loading operation started with [method load_threaded_request] for the resource at [param path]. See [enum ThreadLoadStatus] for possible return values.
				An array variable can optionally be passed via [param progress], and will return a one-element array containing the ratio of completion of the threaded loading (between [code]0.0[/code] and [code]1.0[/code]).
				[b]Note:[/b] The recommended way of using this method is to call it during different frames (e.g., in [method Node._process], instead of a loop).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="load_threaded_request">
			<return type="int" enum="Error" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="type_hint" type="String" default="&quot;&quot;" />
			<param index="2" name="use_sub_threads" type="bool" default="false" />
			<param index="3" name="cache_mode" type="int" enum="ResourceLoader.CacheMode" default="1" />
			<description>
				Loads the resource using threads. If [param use_sub_threads] is [code]true[/code], multiple threads will be used to load the resource, which makes loading faster, but may affect the main thread (and thus cause game slowdowns).
				The [param cache_mode] property defines whether and how the cache should be used or updated when loading the resource. See [enum CacheMode] for details.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="remove_resource_format_loader">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="format_loader" type="ResourceFormatLoader" />
			<description>
				Unregisters the given [ResourceFormatLoader].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="set_abort_on_missing_resources">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="abort" type="bool" />
			<description>
				Changes the behavior on missing sub-resources. The default behavior is to abort loading.
			</description>
