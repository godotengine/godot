	<brief_description>
		A singleton for loading resource files.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A singleton used to load resource files from the filesystem.
		It uses the many [ResourceFormatLoader] classes registered in the engine (either built-in or from a plugin) to load files into memory and convert them to a format that can be used by the engine.
		[b]Note:[/b] You have to import the files into the engine first to load them using [method load]. If you want to load [Image]s at run-time, you may use [method Image.load]. If you want to import audio files, you can use the snippet described in [member AudioStreamMP3.data].
		[b]Note:[/b] Non-resource files such as plain text files cannot be read using [ResourceLoader]. Use [FileAccess] for those files instead, and be aware that non-resource files are not exported by default (see notes in the [FileAccess] class description for instructions on exporting them).

	<methods>
		<method name="add_resource_format_loader">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="format_loader" type="ResourceFormatLoader" />
			<param index="1" name="at_front" type="bool" default="false" />
			<description>
				Registers a new [ResourceFormatLoader]. The ResourceLoader will use the ResourceFormatLoader as described in [method load].
				This method is performed implicitly for ResourceFormatLoaders written in GDScript (see [ResourceFormatLoader] for more information).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="exists">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="type_hint" type="String" default="&quot;&quot;" />
			<description>
				Returns whether a recognized resource exists for the given [param path].
				An optional [param type_hint] can be used to further specify the [Resource] type that should be handled by the [ResourceFormatLoader]. Anything that inherits from [Resource] can be used as a type hint, for example [Image].
				[b]Note:[/b] If you use [method Resource.take_over_path], this method will return [code]true[/code] for the taken path even if the resource wasn't saved (i.e. exists only in resource cache).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_cached_ref">
			<return type="Resource" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the cached resource reference for the given [param path].
				[b]Note:[/b] If the resource is not cached, the returned [Resource] will be invalid.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_dependencies">
			<return type="PackedStringArray" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the dependencies for the resource at the given [param path].
				Each dependency is a string that can be divided into sections by [code]::[/code]. There can be either one section or three sections, with the second section always being empty. When there is one section, it contains the file path. When there are three sections, the first section contains the UID and the third section contains the fallback path.
				[codeblock]
				for dependency in ResourceLoader.get_dependencies(path):
					if dependency.contains("::"):
						print(dependency.get_slice("::", 0)) # Prints the UID.
						print(dependency.get_slice("::", 2)) # Prints the fallback path.
					else:
						print(dependency) # Prints the path.
				[/codeblock]
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_recognized_extensions_for_type">
			<return type="PackedStringArray" />
			<param index="0" name="type" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the list of recognized extensions for a resource type.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="get_resource_uid">
			<return type="int" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the ID associated with a given resource path, or [code]-1[/code] when no such ID exists.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="has_cached">
			<return type="bool" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns whether a cached resource is available for the given [param path].
				Once a resource has been loaded by the engine, it is cached in memory for faster access, and future calls to the [method load] method will use the cached version. The cached resource can be overridden by using [method Resource.take_over_path] on a new resource for that same path.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="list_directory">
			<return type="PackedStringArray" />
			<param index="0" name="directory_path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Lists a directory, returning all resources and subdirectories contained within. The resource files have the original file names as visible in the editor before exporting. The directories have [code]"/"[/code] appended.
				[codeblock]
				# Prints ["extra_data/", "model.gltf", "model.tscn", "model_slime.png"]
				print(ResourceLoader.list_directory("res://assets/enemies/slime"))
				[/codeblock]
				[b]Note:[/b] The order of files and directories returned by this method is not deterministic, and can vary between operating systems.
				[b]Note:[/b] To normally traverse the filesystem, see [DirAccess].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="load">
			<return type="Resource" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="type_hint" type="String" default="&quot;&quot;" />
			<param index="2" name="cache_mode" type="int" enum="ResourceLoader.CacheMode" default="1" />
			<description>
				Loads a resource at the given [param path], caching the result for further access.
				The registered [ResourceFormatLoader]s are queried sequentially to find the first one which can handle the file's extension, and then attempt loading. If loading fails, the remaining ResourceFormatLoaders are also attempted.
				An optional [param type_hint] can be used to further specify the [Resource] type that should be handled by the [ResourceFormatLoader]. Anything that inherits from [Resource] can be used as a type hint, for example [Image].
				The [param cache_mode] property defines whether and how the cache should be used or updated when loading the resource.
				Returns an empty resource if no [ResourceFormatLoader] could handle the file, and prints an error if no file is found at the specified path.
				GDScript has a simplified [method @GDScript.load] built-in method which can be used in most situations, leaving the use of [ResourceLoader] for more advanced scenarios.
				[b]Note:[/b] If [member ProjectSettings.editor/export/convert_text_resources_to_binary] is [code]true[/code], [method @GDScript.load] will not be able to read converted files in an exported project. If you rely on run-time loading of files present within the PCK, set [member ProjectSettings.editor/export/convert_text_resources_to_binary] to [code]false[/code].
				[b]Note:[/b] Relative paths will be prefixed with [code]"res://"[/code] before loading, to avoid unexpected results make sure your paths are absolute.

		</method>
		<method name="load_threaded_get">
			<return type="Resource" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<description>
				Returns the resource loaded by [method load_threaded_request].
				If this is called before the loading thread is done (i.e. [method load_threaded_get_status] is not [constant THREAD_LOAD_LOADED]), the calling thread will be blocked until the resource has finished loading. However, it's recommended to use [method load_threaded_get_status] to known when the load has actually completed.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="load_threaded_get_status">
			<return type="int" enum="ResourceLoader.ThreadLoadStatus" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="progress" type="Array" default="[]" />
			<description>
				Returns the status of a threaded loading operation started with [method load_threaded_request] for the resource at [param path].
				An array variable can optionally be passed via [param progress], and will return a one-element array containing the ratio of completion of the threaded loading (between [code]0.0[/code] and [code]1.0[/code]).
				[b]Note:[/b] The recommended way of using this method is to call it during different frames (e.g., in [method Node._process], instead of a loop).
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="load_threaded_request">
			<return type="int" enum="Error" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="type_hint" type="String" default="&quot;&quot;" />
			<param index="2" name="use_sub_threads" type="bool" default="false" />
			<param index="3" name="cache_mode" type="int" enum="ResourceLoader.CacheMode" default="1" />
			<description>
				Loads the resource using threads. If [param use_sub_threads] is [code]true[/code], multiple threads will be used to load the resource, which makes loading faster, but may affect the main thread (and thus cause game slowdowns).
				The [param cache_mode] parameter defines whether and how the cache should be used or updated when loading the resource.
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="remove_resource_format_loader">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="format_loader" type="ResourceFormatLoader" />
			<description>
				Unregisters the given [ResourceFormatLoader].
			</description>
		</method>
		<method name="rename_dependencies">
			<return type="int" enum="Error" />
			<param index="0" name="path" type="String" />
			<param index="1" name="rename_paths_from_to" type="Dictionary" />
			<description>
				Renames resource dependency paths from their current path to a replacement path. Rename paths are confirmed to exist in the resource file before renaming.
				[param rename_paths_from_to] is a [Dictionary] with each key a [String] that is a path to replace in the exact format as a key returned by [method get_dependencies], and its value a [String] as the replacement path without the UID. See [method get_dependencies] on how to get the path from the dependency [String] slices.
				[codeblocks]
				[gdscript]
				var rename_paths_from_to = {
				    "uid://cy6m27ymhc1l1::::res://local/my_script_101.gd":"res://migrate/local/my_script_101.gd",
				    "uid://cprj8dpcbi7f5::::res://local/my_script_202.gd":"res://migrate/local/my_script_202.gd",
				}
				[/gdscript]
				[/codeblocks]
				If the resource is a file located in the [code]res://[/code] path the rename is performed immediately on the source file.
				If the resource is located in the [code]user://[/code] path, a new resource file is created at the same location as the original. The original file is not modified. The name of the new, modified resource at [param path] is dependent on the particular [ResourceFormatLoader] used by the resource type. [PackedScene] resources, [code].tscn[/code] and [code].scn[/code] are saved with the original [param path] name appended with [code].depren[/code].
				[b]Note:[/b] Resources that were saved prior to Godot 4.0 will not show a UID in the dependency key, so the [param rename_paths_from_to] key/value will look like this: [code]"res://local/my_script_303.gd":"res://migrate/local/my_script_303.gd"[/code].

		</method>
		<method name="set_abort_on_missing_resources">
			<return type="void" />
			<param index="0" name="abort" type="bool" />
			<description>
				Changes the behavior on missing sub-resources. The default behavior is to abort loading.
