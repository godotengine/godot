		<member name="initial_offset" type="float" setter="set_initial_offset" getter="get_initial_offset" default="25.0">
			The body B's initial anchor position defined by the joint's origin and a local offset [member initial_offset] along the joint's Y axis (along the groove).
		</member>
		<member name="length" type="float" setter="set_length" getter="get_length" default="50.0">
			The groove's length. The groove is from the joint's origin towards [member length] along the joint's local Y axis.
