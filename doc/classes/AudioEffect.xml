	<brief_description>
		Base class for audio effect resources.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The base [Resource] for every audio effect. In the editor, an audio effect can be added to the current bus layout through the Audio panel. At run-time, it is also possible to manipulate audio effects through [method AudioServer.add_bus_effect], [method AudioServer.remove_bus_effect], and [method AudioServer.get_bus_effect].
		When applied on a bus, an audio effect creates a corresponding [AudioEffectInstance]. The instance is directly responsible for manipulating the sound, based on the original audio effect's properties.

				Override this method to customize the [AudioEffectInstance] created when this effect is applied on a bus in the editor's Audio panel, or through [method AudioServer.add_bus_effect].
				[codeblock]
				extends AudioEffect

				@export var strength = 4.0

				func _instantiate():
					var effect = CustomAudioEffectInstance.new()
					effect.base = self

					return effect
				[/codeblock]
				[b]Note:[/b] It is recommended to keep a reference to the original [AudioEffect] in the new instance. Depending on the implementation this allows the effect instance to listen for changes at run-time and be modified accordingly.
