		A 3D world boundary (half-space) shape used for physics collision.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		A 3D world boundary shape, intended for use in physics. [WorldBoundaryShape3D] works like an infinite plane that forces all physics bodies to stay above it. The [member plane]'s normal determines which direction is considered as "above" and in the editor, the line over the plane represents this direction. It can for example be used for endless flat floors.
