// Design goals for these classes:
// - No automatic conversions to keep explicit the use of atomics everywhere.
// - Using acquire-release semantics, even to set the first value.
//   The first value may be set relaxedly in many cases, but adding the distinction
//   between relaxed and unrelaxed operation to the interface would make it needlessly
//   flexible. There's negligible waste in having release semantics for the initial
//   value and, as an important benefit, you can be sure the value is properly synchronized
//   even with threads that are already running.
// - Provide a safe way to set pointer value from multiple threads without using locks.

// These are used in very specific areas of the engine where it's critical that these guarantees are held.
