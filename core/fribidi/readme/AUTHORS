behdad: Behdad Esfahbod <behdad@gnu.org>
#
# Behdad Esfahbod is the only author that actually codes these days.  He
# maintains the package too.  He has revised all of the code written by
# others, and has written much of the code himself.  He's listed (or should
# be listed) on every file in the package as one of the authors.  Behdad
# designs, implements, documents, maintains, ...
#

dov-g: Dov Grobgeld <dov@imagic.weizmann.ac.il>
#
# Dov Grobgeld originally wrote FriBidi.  The 0.1.* releases were all done
# by him.  After that, Dov rarely touched the code, but contributed ideas. 
# All files that he has originally authored have him listed as an author in
# the header of the file.
#

roozbeh: Roozbeh Pournader <roozbeh@gnu.org>
#
# Roozbeh Pournader hasn't contributed much code to FriBidi personally; but
# has maintained, promoted, and supported the project for a while.  He has
# helped with making GNU FriBidi standards compliant, and has sometimes
# lobbied with the Unicode Consortium when needed.  Roozbeh was supposed to
# be a co-maintainer of GNU FriBidi, but he's not doing that yet.
#


#
# Note: Other people have contributed significant amounts of code, but
# usually the code has faded out because of restructuring and redesigning
# things around GNU FriBidi.  As an example, the FriBidiEnv patch by Omer
# Zak, made itself into FriBidi CVS for a couple of years, but was finally
# implemented in a better way by Behdad.
#
# Note: GNU getopt is distributed with and used in GNU FriBidi under bin/, but
# is not part of GNU FriBidi.
#
# Note: Parts of the Unicode Character Database are distributed with and used
# in GNU FriBidi under gen.tab/unidata/, but are not part of GNU FriBidi.
