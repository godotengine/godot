# Merge Conflict Resolution for C# Web Export

## Issue

When trying to merge the `cs-web-export` branch with `master`, a merge conflict occurred in the `gd_mono.cpp` file. The conflict was between:

1. The C# web export support implementation (with fixed indentation in the WEB_ENABLED block)
2. Significant new code added to master for .NET runtime loading

## Resolution

The merge conflict was resolved by:

1. Preserving the properly indented WEB_ENABLED block from our `cs-web-export` branch:
   ```cpp
   #ifdef WEB_ENABLED
   	// For web platform, we need to set up the Mono runtime differently
   	// The runtime is statically linked in this case
   	print_verbose("Mono: Static linking for web platform.");
   	runtime_initialized = true;
   	_domain = nullptr;

   	mono_jit_init("godot");
   	
   	_load_assemblies(p_resource_dir_path);

   	return;
   #endif
   ```

2. Incorporating all the new code from `master` branch, including:
   - Additional includes
   - New helper functions for .NET runtime loading
   - hostfxr initialization code
   - CoreCLR support

## Verification Steps

To ensure the merge was successful:

1. Build the engine with C# support:
   ```
   scons platform=macos target=editor module_mono_enabled=yes
   ```

2. Verify that both Linux and macOS builds work correctly with the merged code

3. Test C# web export functionality to ensure it still works as intended

## Future Considerations

When making further changes to the C# web export implementation, be aware that:

1. The code base might continue to evolve with more .NET runtime loading changes
2. The WEB_ENABLED block must maintain proper indentation inside the GDMono::initialize method
3. Any web-specific behavior should be properly isolated in the WEB_ENABLED block
