JIT is a fork of Godot made in the odd event that it is ever needed. Not that I really have anything ageinst Godot, I love this engine! It's helping me make my dreams come true man! 

I just worry that something might go wrong with Godot's development at some point and I might be better off working with a code base that was made "before things went wrong"... 

I'm not gonna make my own game engine from scratch, ya know? That would be educational, but silly... so I'll probably just stick to Godot! And worst comes to worst I'll just become the head developer of my own Fork...

I mean this is why I pick only FOSS software in the first place, if the developers screw up too much, you just Fork is and move on with your life.

Politics should not get in the way of clean code!

I think what I'll do, going forward is this will just be a personal project for me to get better at game design in general. I'll keep the codebase more or less locked-in at the current version (4.4 beta) and free from any further Code upsteam, and only implament changes by hand, so I can meticulously inspect every code bit that goes into the system and insure "My" engine keeps in line with the clean design phlosphy Godot is known for, in case that ever changes. I'm not a super advanced Dev right now, but I'm old enough to know, sometimes it's just better to do these things youself. Which is why I picked a FOSS engine to begin with!

Hopfully this will just be good fun!


Update 9, 28, 2024
	Well, I've been watching videos from all the haters of Godot and listening to a lot of arguments being made againt Godot and in particaul Juan, Godot's lead developer. 
 
I've come to one of two conclusions about the nature of Godot:
		Juan is a cult leader, and Godot is a literal cult run by someone who literally wants to rule the world and is using "Open Source" as a ruse to do it.
		Juan is an incompetent leader, who's allowed a toxic enviroment to continue that's incredably hostile to any developer with opinons outside of neo-liberal/marixst-communist thought.

In this sense it really dosen't matter which of these situations is true, because logicly the solutions to both of these problems is the same if we are to continue to use Godot to make our games:
		Godot needs a community that's not part of the broken inner strucutre of the Godot foundation. One were developers can talk objectivly about the problems they are experincing with Godot and recive feedback and soultion, and working with developers who have no alterniatvie motivations outside of simply making the best game engine out there for whatever kind of games people are going to make.

As such the future of the JIT-Engine is to do extaclly that. 

This is what's needed for myself if I'm going to continue to use this engine to make thought provoking games, and it's needed by the overall Godot community because group think is bad and leads to sagnation and authoritarianism.

I'm sure over the course of this jounry I'll end up becoming everything that I hate, as if God himself was mocking me. But for the time being, there is no other choice, and if I'm going to solve the problem of getting from point A. (having a game idea) to point B (Relaseing my game and making a bunch of $$ so I can sip wine and talk about golfing or whatever at country clubs in my old age) this is the soultion that must be done now. 

So I guess I'm going to try and make that happens.
