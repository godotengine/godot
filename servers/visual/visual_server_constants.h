#ifndef VISUAL_SERVER_CONSTANTS_H
#define VISUAL_SERVER_CONSTANTS_H

// Use for constants etc that need not be included as often as VisualServer.h
// to reduce dependencies and prevent slow compilation.

// This is a "cheap" include, and can be used from scene side code as well as servers.

// Uncomment to provide comparison of node culling versus item culling
// #define VISUAL_SERVER_CANVAS_TIME_NODE_CULLING

// N.B. ONLY allow these defined in DEV_ENABLED builds, they will slow
// performance, and are only necessary to use for debugging.
#ifdef DEV_ENABLED

// Uncomment this define to store canvas item names in VisualServerCanvas.
// This is relatively expensive, but is invaluable for debugging the canvas scene tree
// especially using _print_tree() in VisualServerCanvas.
// #define VISUAL_SERVER_CANVAS_DEBUG_ITEM_NAMES

// Uncomment this define to verify local bounds of canvas items,
// to check that the hierarchical culling is working correctly.
// This is expensive.
// #define VISUAL_SERVER_CANVAS_CHECK_BOUNDS

#endif // DEV_ENABLED
