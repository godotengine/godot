/// Interface for making it easier to work with UMA.
///
/// # What is UMA?
///
/// It stands for Unified Memory Architecture. There are two kinds of UMA:
///	 1. HW UMA. This is the case of iGPUs (specially Android, iOS, Apple ARM-based macOS, PS4 & PS5)
///		The CPU and GPU share the same die and same memory. So regular RAM and VRAM are internally the
///		same thing. There may be some differences between them in practice due to cache synchronization
///		behaviors or the regular BW RAM may be purposely throttled (as is the case of PS4 & PS5).
///  2. "Pretended UMA". On PC Desktop GPUs with ReBAR enabled can pretend VRAM behaves like normal
///		RAM, while internally the data is moved across the PCIe Bus. This can cause differences
///		in execution time of the routines that write to GPU buffers as the region is often uncached
///		(i.e. write-combined) and PCIe latency and BW is vastly different from regular RAM.
///		Without ReBAR, the amount of UMA memory is limited to 256MB (shared by the entire system).
///
/// Since often this type of memory is uncached, it is not well-suited for downloading GPU -> CPU,
/// but rather for uploading CPU -> GPU.
///
/// # When to use UMA buffers?
///
/// UMA buffers have various caveats and improper usage might lead to visual glitches. Therefore they
/// should be used sparingly, where it makes a difference. Does all of the following check?:
///	  1. Data is uploaded from CPU to GPU every (or almost every) frame.
///   2. Data is always uploaded from scratch. Partial uploads are unsupported.
///	  3. If uploading multiple times per frame (e.g. for multiple passes). The amount of times
///      per frame is relatively stable (occasional spikes are fine if using MAX_EXTRA_BUFFERS).
///
/// # Why the caveats?
///
///	This is due to our inability to detect race conditions. If you write to an UMA buffer, submit
///	GPU commands and then write more data to it, we can't guarantee that you won't be writing to a
/// region the GPU is currently reading from. Tools like the validation layers cannot detect this
/// race condition at all, making it very hard to troubleshoot.
///
/// Therefore the safest approach is to use an interface that forces users to upload everything at once.
/// There is one exception for performance: map_raw_for_upload() will return a pointer, and it is your
/// responsibility to make sure you don't use that pointer again after submitting.
/// USE THIS API CALL SPARINGLY AND WITH CARE.
///
/// Since we forbid uploading more data after we've uploaded to it, this Interface will create
/// more buffers. This means users will need more UniformSets (i.e. uniform_set_create).
///
/// # How to use
///
/// Example code 01:
///		MultiUmaBuffer<1> uma_buffer = MultiUmaBuffer<1>("Debug name displayed if run with --verbose");
///		uma_buffer.set_size(0, max_size_bytes, false);
///
///		for(uint32_t i = 0u; i < num_passes; ++i) {
///			uma_buffer.prepare_for_upload(); // Creates a new buffer (if none exists already)
///											 // of max_size_bytes. Must be called.
///			uma_buffer.upload(0, src_data, size_bytes);
///
///			if(!uniform_set[i]) {
///				RD::Uniform u;
///				u.binding = 1;
///				u.uniform_type = RD::UNIFORM_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_DYNAMIC;
///				u.append_id(uma_buffer._get(0u));
///				uniform_set[i] = rd->uniform_set_create( ... );
///			}
///		}
///
///	  // On shutdown (or if you need to call set_size again).
///	  uma_buffer.uninit();
///
/// Example code 02:
///
///		uma_buffer.prepare_for_upload();
///		RID rid = uma_buffer.get_for_upload(0u);
///		rd->buffer_update(rid, 0, sizeof(BakeParameters), &bake_parameters);
///		RD::Uniform u; // Skipping full initialization of u. See Example 01.
///		u.append_id(rid);
///
/// Example code 03:
///
///		void *dst_data = uma_buffer.map_raw_for_upload(0u);
///		memcpy(dst_data, src_data, size_bytes);
///		rd->buffer_flush(uma_buffer._get(0u));
///		RD::Uniform u; // Skipping full initialization of u. See Example 01.
///		u.append_id(rid);
///
/// # Tricks
///
///	Godot's shadow mapping code calls uma_buffer.uniform_buffers._get(-p_pass_offset) (i.e. a negative value)
/// because for various reasons its shadow mapping code was written like this:
///
///		for( uint32_t i = 0u; i < num_passes; ++i ) {
///			uma_buffer.prepare_for_upload();
///			uma_buffer.upload(0, src_data, size_bytes);
///		}
///		for( uint32_t i = 0u; i < num_passes; ++i ) {
///			RD::Uniform u;
///			u.binding = 1;
///			u.uniform_type = RD::UNIFORM_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_DYNAMIC;
///			u.append_id(uma_buffer._get(-(num_passes - 1u - i)));
///			uniform_set[i] = rd->uniform_set_create( ... );
///		}
///
/// Every time prepare_for_upload() is called, uma_buffer._get(-idx) will return a different RID(*).
/// Thus with a negative value we can address previous ones. This is fine as long as the value idx
/// doesn't exceed the number of times the user called prepare_for_upload() for this frame.
///
/// (*)This RID will be returned again on the next frame after the same amount of prepare_for_upload()
/// calls; unless the number of times it was called exceeded MAX_EXTRA_BUFFERS.
///
/// # Template parameters
///
///	## NUM_BUFFERS
///
/// How many buffers we should track. e.g. instead of doing this:
///		MultiUmaBuffer<1> omni_lights = /*...*/;
///		MultiUmaBuffer<1> spot_lights = /*...*/;
///		MultiUmaBuffer<1> directional_lights = /*...*/;
///
///		omni_lights.set_size(0u, omni_size);
///		spot_lights.set_size(0u, spot_size);
///		directional_lights.set_size(0u, dir_size);
///
///		omni_lights.prepare_for_upload();
///		spot_lights.prepare_for_upload();
///		directional_lights.prepare_for_upload();
///
/// You can do this:
///
///		MultiUmaBuffer<3> lights = /*...*/;
///
///		lights.set_size(0u, omni_size);
///		lights.set_size(1u, spot_size);
///		lights.set_size(2u, dir_size);
///
///		lights.prepare_for_upload();
///
/// This approach works as long as all buffers would call prepare_for_upload() at the same time.
/// It saves some overhead.
///
/// ## MAX_EXTRA_BUFFERS
///
/// Upper limit on the number of buffers per frame.
///
/// There are times where rendering might spike for exceptional reasons, calling prepare_for_upload()
/// too many times, never to do that again. This will cause an increase in memory usage that will
/// never be reclaimed until shutdown.
///
/// MAX_EXTRA_BUFFERS can be used to handle such spikes, by deallocating the extra buffers.
/// Example:
///		MultiUmaBuffer<1, 6> buffer;
///
///		// Normal frame (assuming up to 6 passes is considered normal):
///		for(uint32_t i = 0u; i < 6u; ++i) {
///			buffer.prepare_for_upload();
///			...
///			buffer.upload(...);
///		}
///
///		// Exceptional frame:
///		for(uint32_t i = 0u; i < 24u; ++i) {
///			buffer.prepare_for_upload();
///			...
///			buffer.upload(...);
///		}
///
///	After the frame is done, those extra 18 buffers will be deleted.
/// Launching godot with --verbose will print diagnostic information.
